\section{Cycle Averages}
\label{s:DynAvers}

So far, we have explained how we find the \rpo s of the \twomode\ system in 
its \reducedsp\ and how to compute their stability. However, we have not yet
said anything about what to do with these numbers. We begin this section with 
an overview of the main results of the periodic orbit theory, referring the reader 
to \refref{DasBuch} for a detailed introduction to the subject. Our discussion 
closely follows the presentation of \refref{DasBuch} with the addition of how 
the theory is modified in the presence of continuous symmetries in 
\refsect{s-ContFac}. In \refsect{s-CycExp}, we present cycle expansions and
explain how to approximate the Poincar\'e section in 
\reffig{fig:psectandretmap} (d), in order to obtain a better convergence of 
the spectral determinants. We finish this section with the numerical results in 
\refsect{s-NumResults}

\subsection{Classical trace formula}
Consider the {\evOper}, the action of which evolves a density 
$\rho_0(\ssp)$ in the \statesp :
\bea
    \rho(\zeit ,\ssp) &=& [\Lop^\zeit \rho_0 ] (\ssp) \, , \continue
    &=& \int d \ssp' \delta (\ssp - \flow{\zeit}{\ssp'}) 
        e^{\beta \Obser^\zeit (\ssp' )} \rho_0(\ssp') \, .
        \label{e-EvOper}
\eea
Here, $\beta$ is an auxiliary variable and $\Obser^\zeit (\ssp')$ is the 
integrated value of an `additive' observable $\obser$ along the orbit 
$\flow{\zeit}{\ssp'}$:
\beq
    \Obser^\zeit (\ssp' ) = \int_0^{\zeit} d \zeit' 
                              \obser(\flow{\zeit'}{\ssp'}) \, .
\eeq
Notice that when $\beta = 0$, the \evOper\ \refeq{e-EvOper} simply evolves 
the density of \statesp\ points to its new form after time $\zeit$. As we 
shall see, attaching\DB{2014-11-3}{What does ``attaching'' mean in this context... might be lacking technical rigor here.} 
the integrated observables to this operator enables us to 
study values of these observables averaged over the invariant measures. 

Since we required our observable to be additive along an orbit and 
exponentiated its integrated value in the construction of the \evOper\ 
\refeq{e-EvOper}; the evolution operator itself is multiplicative:
\beq
    \Lop^{\zeit_1 + \zeit_2} = \Lop^{\zeit_2} \Lop^{\zeit_1} \, .
    \label{eq-SemiGroup}
\eeq
For the kernel of the evolution integral, which we will refer to as 
$\Lop^\zeit (\ssp, \ssp')$ with explicit arguments, we can write this relation 
as:
\beq
	\Lop^{\zeit_1 + \zeit_2} (\ssp,\ssp') = 
    \int d\ssp'' \Lop^{\zeit_2} (\ssp, \ssp'') 
                   \Lop^{\zeit_1} (\ssp'', \ssp) \, .
	\label{eq-SemiGroupKernel}
\eeq
This `semigroup property' \refeq{eq-SemiGroup} of the {\evOper} allows us to 
define the {\evOper} as the formal exponential of its infinitesimal generator 
\Aop :
\beq
	\Lop^t = e^{\Aop t} \, .
	\label{eq-EvOpExp}
\eeq
By definition \refeq{e-EvOper}, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of $\Lop^t$ (and
thus \Aop ) are functions of $\beta$. Let us define $\rho_{\beta} (x)$ as the
eigenfunction of \refeq{e-EvOper} corresponding to the leading eigenvalue (i.e., the one with the
largest real part); we can write the action of \refeq{e-EvOper} on this density
explicitly as follows:
\beq
    \left[ \Lop^t \rho_{\beta} \right] (x) = e^{t s(\beta )} \rho_{\beta} (x) 
    \, .
    \label{eq-EigenvalueRel}
\eeq
Here, $s(\beta)$ is the eigenvalue of $\Aop$. As stated earlier, when 
$\beta = 0$, the {\evOper} simply evolves densities; this form of the evolution
operator is known as the {\FPoper}. If we assume that the system under study is ergodic, 
then an `invariant measure' $\rho_0(\ssp)$ exists with eigenvalue 
$s(0) = 0$ exists. The long time spectrum of any observable is going to be dominated by 
its average over such a density, hence we define the average of an observable
as its average over the invariant measure:
\beq
    \langle \obser \rangle = \int d \ssp \, \obser(\ssp) \rho_0 (\ssp) \, .
    \label{e-obserAvg}
\eeq
By evaluating the action of the {\evOper} \refeq{e-EvOper} for infinitesimal 
times and after some algebra, which we skip here, one finds that the 
averages of observables, as well as their higher moments, can be generated from the 
derivatives of $s(\beta)$:
\beq
    \langle \obser \rangle = 
        \left. \frac{d s}{d \beta} \right|_{\beta = 0} \, , \quad
    \langle (\obser - \langle \obser \rangle )^2 \rangle = 
        \left. \frac{d^2 s}{d \beta^2} \right|_{\beta = 0} \,, ...
    \label{eq-moments}
\eeq
In order to obtain $s(\beta)$, we construct the resolvent of \Aop , by taking 
the Laplace transform of \refeq{eq-EvOpExp}:
\beq
	\int_0^{\infty} d\zeit e^{-s\zeit} \Lop^\zeit = (s-\Aop)^{-1} \, ,
	\label{eq-ResolventA}
\eeq
the trace of which peaks at the eigenvalues of \Aop. By taking the
Laplace transform of $\Lop^\zeit$ and computing its trace
by $\tr \Lop^\zeit = \int d\ssp \Lop^\zeit (\ssp,\ssp)$, one obtains the
classical trace formula:
\beq
\sum_{\alpha=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{s-s_{\alpha}} = \sum_p T_p
\sum_{r=1}^{\infty} \frac{e^{r(\beta \Obser_p - s T_p)}}{\oneMinJ{r}} 
\ee{e-ClassicalTraceFormula}
that relates the spectrum of the {\evOper} to the spectrum of the periodic
orbits. Here,  $s$ is the auxiliary
variable of the Laplace transform and $s_{\alpha}$ are the eigenvalues of \Aop . The
outer sum on the right hand side runs over the `prime cycles' $p$ of the system,
which have periods $T_p$. $\Obser_p$ is the value of
the observable integrated along the prime cycle and $\monodromy_p$ is the transverse
monodromy matrix, the eigenvalues of which are the Floquet multipliers of $p$ 
excluding the marginal ones ($|\Lambda| \neq 1$). In the derivation of 
\refeq{e-ClassicalTraceFormula}, one assumes that the flow has a single marginal direction, 
namely the direction that is parallel to the periodic orbit at all times, and evaluates the 
contribution of each \po\ to the trace integral by transforming to a local coordinate 
system where one of the coordinates is 
parallel to the flow while the rest is transverse. Integration along the 
parallel direction is what contributes the factors of $T_p$. The transverse integral 
over the delta function contributes the factor of $\oneMinJ{r}$. 

\subsection{Continuous factorization}
\label{s-ContFac}

The classical trace formula \refeq{e-ClassicalTraceFormula} accounts for contributions from \po s
to long time dynamical averages. However, \rpo s of equivariant systems are almost never 
periodic in the full \statesp . In order to compute the contributions of \rpo s 
to the trace of the \evOper, one has to factorize\DB{}{factor or factorize... not sure which sounds better... 
are they different?} the \evOper\ 
into the irreducible subspaces of the symmetry group. For discrete symmetries, 
this procedure is studied in \refref{CvitaEckardt} and for the quantum systems 
with continuous symmetries (Abelian and 3D rotations), factorization of 
semiclassical Green's operator is carried out in \refref{Creagh93}. 
\refRef{Cvi07} addresses the continuous factorization of the \evOper\ and its 
trace; we provide a sketch of this treatment here. We start by stating, without
proof, that a square-integrable field $\psi (\ssp)$ over a vector space can be 
factorized into its projections over the irreducible subspaces of a group 
$\Group$: 
\beq
    \psi (\ssp) = \sum_m P_m \psi (\ssp) \, ,
\eeq
where the sum runs over the irreducible representations of the $\Group$ and 
the projection operator onto the $m$th irreducible subspace, for a continuous
group, is:
\beq
    P_m = d_m \int_\Group d \mu(g) \chi_m (\LieEl(\theta)) 
                            D(\LieEl(\theta)) \, .
    \label{e-ProjectionOperator}
\eeq 
Here, $d_m$ is the dimension of the representation, $d \mu(g)$ is the 
normalized `Haar measure', $\chi_m (\LieEl)$ is the `character' of $m$th 
irreducible representation and $D(\LieEl(\theta))$ is the operator which 
transforms a scalar field defined on \statesp\ according to $\LieEl (\theta)$, 
namely, $D(\LieEl(\theta)) \rho (\ssp) = \rho(\LieEl^{-1}(\theta) \ssp)$ \DB{2014-11-3}{Added missing parenthesis to 
this expression. Did I put it in the right place? I think so, but please double check.}. For 
our specific case of single $\SOn{2}$ symmetry, 
\bea
d_m &\rightarrow& 1\, , \\
\int_G d \mu(g) &\rightarrow& \oint \frac{d \theta} {2 \pi} \, , \\
\chi_m (\LieEl(\theta)) &\rightarrow& e^{- \ii m \theta } \, .
\eea
Since the projection 
operator \refeq{e-ProjectionOperator} factorizes scalar fields in the \statesp\ 
into their projections onto irreducible subspaces of the $\Group$, it can be used to 
factorize the \evOper\ since the \evOper\ acts on scalar 
fields (densities) and returns scalar fields on the \statesp . Thus the kernel 
of the \evOper\ transforms under the action of $D(\LieEl(\theta))$ as:
\bea
    D(\LieEl(\theta)) \Lop^t (\ssp', \ssp) &=& 
        \Lop^t (\LieEl^{-1}(\theta) \ssp', \ssp)\,,
    \continue
    &=& \Lop^t (\ssp', \LieEl(\theta) \ssp) \,, \continue
    &=& \delta (\ssp' - \LieEl(\theta) f^t (\ssp)) e^{\beta \Obser^t(\ssp)}\, ,
    \label{e-gEvOper}
\eea
where the second step followed from the equivariance of the system under 
consideration. \Rpo s contribute to the $P_m \Lop^t = \Lop_m^t$ since when its 
kernel is modified as in \refeq{e-gEvOper}, the projection involves an integral 
over the group parameters that will be non-zero at the phase shift of the 
\rpo s. By computing the trace of $\Lop_m^t$, which in addition to the integral
over \statesp , now involves another integral over the group parameters, one 
obtains the $m$th irreducible subspace contribution to the classical trace as
\beq
\sum_{\alpha=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{s-s_{m, \alpha}} = \sum_p T_p
\sum_{r=1}^{\infty} \frac{\chi_m (\LieEl^r(\theta_p)) 
            e^{r(\beta \Obser_p - s T_p)}}{\oneMinJred{r}} .
\ee{e-ReducedTraceFormula}
The reduced trace formula \refeq{e-ReducedTraceFormula} differs from the 
classical trace formula \refeq{e-ClassicalTraceFormula} by the group character
term, which is evaluated at the \rpo\ phase shifts, and the reduced monodromy
matrix $\monodromyRed$, which is the $(d-N-1)\times(d-N-1)$ reduced Jacobian 
for the \rpo\ evaluated on a Poincar\'e section in the \reducedsp . The eigenvalues
of $\monodromyRed$ are those of the \rpo\ Jacobian \refeq{e-rpoJacobian} 
excluding the marginal ones, i.e., the ones corresponding to time evolution and evolution 
along the continuous symmetry directions.

Since we are only interested in the leading eigenvalue of the \evOper , we are 
going to consider contributions only from the $0$th irreducible subspace to the 
trace \refeq{e-ClassicalTraceFormula} from its projections 
\refeq{e-ReducedTraceFormula} which we can write for our $\SOn{2}$ case 
explicitly as \DB{2014-11-3}{This sentence is weird but I'm kind of lost at this point, so
I don't know how to fix it.}
\beq
\sum_{\alpha=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{s-s_{0, \alpha}} = \sum_p T_p
\sum_{r=1}^{\infty} \frac{e^{r(\beta \Obser_p - s T_p)}}{\oneMinJred{r}} \, .
\ee{e-tracem0}
This form differs from the classical trace formula 
\refeq{e-ClassicalTraceFormula} only by the reduced monodromy matrix since 
the $0$th irreducible representation of $\SOn{2}$ has character $1$. For this 
reason, cycle expansions \rf{AACI}, which we will cover next, are applicable
to \refeq{e-tracem0} after the replacement 
$\monodromy \rightarrow \monodromyRed$. 

\subsection{Cycle expansions}
\label{s-CycExp}

While the classical trace formula \refeq{e-ClassicalTraceFormula} and its 
factorization for systems with continuous symmetry \refeq{e-ReducedTraceFormula} manifest
the essential duality between the spectrum of an observable and that of
the \po s and \rpo s, in practice, they are hard to work with since the 
eigenvalues are located at the poles of \refeq{e-ClassicalTraceFormula} and
\refeq{e-ReducedTraceFormula}. The dynamical zeta function 
\refeq{e-DynamicalZeta}, which we derive below provides a perturbative expansion form,
which enables us to order terms in decreasing importance while computing 
spectra for the \twomode\ system. As stated earlier, \refeq{e-tracem0}
is equivalent to the \refeq{e-ClassicalTraceFormula} via substitution 
$\monodromy \rightarrow \monodromyRed$. We start by defining the 
`spectral determinant':
\beq
  \det (s-\Aop) = \exp \left( - \sum_p \sum_{r=1}^{\infty}
      \frac{1}{r} \frac{e^{r(\beta \Obser_p - s T_p)}}{\oneMinJ{r}} \right)\, ,
\ee{e-SpectralDeterminant}
whose logarithmic derivative ($(d/ds) \ln \det(s - \Aop)$) gives 
the classical trace formula \refeq{e-ClassicalTraceFormula}.
The spectral determinant \refeq{e-SpectralDeterminant} is easier to work
with since the spectrum of $\mathcal{A}$ is now located at the zeros of
\refeq{e-SpectralDeterminant}. The convergence of \refeq{e-SpectralDeterminant}
is, however, still not obvious. More insight is gained by approximating 
$\oneMinJ{r}$ by the product of expanding Floquet multipliers and then 
carrying out the sum over $r$ in \refeq{e-SpectralDeterminant}. This 
approximation yields
\bea
\oneMinJ{} &=& | (1 - \ExpaEig_{e,1})(1 - \ExpaEig_{e,2})... \continue
			&&(1 - \ExpaEig_{c,1}) (1 - \ExpaEig_{c,2}) ... | \nonumber \\
			&\approx& \prod_e |\ExpaEig_e| \equiv |\ExpaEig_p|,
    \label{e-LambdapApprox}
\eea
where $|\ExpaEig_{e,i}| > 1$ and $|\ExpaEig_{c,i}| < 1$ are expanding and 
contracting Floquet multipliers respectively. The sum over $r$ in 
\refeq{e-SpectralDeterminant} becomes the Taylor expansion of natural logarithm 
after approximation \refeq{e-LambdapApprox}. Carrying out this sum, brings the 
spectral determinant \refeq{e-SpectralDeterminant} to a product (over prime 
cycles) known as the dynamical zeta function:   
\beq
1 / \zeta = \prod_p (1 - t_p) \, \mbox{where}, \, t_p = \frac{1}{|\ExpaEig_p|} 
            e^{\beta \Obser_p - s T_p} z^{n_p} .
\ee{e-DynamicalZeta}
We multiplied each `cycle weight' $t_p$ by the `order tracking term' $z^{n_p}$ 
where $n_p$ is the topological length of the $p$th prime cycle. This polynomial
ordering arises naturally in the study of discrete time systems where the
Laplace transform is replaced by $z$-transform. Here, we insert the powers of 
$z$ by hand and we will set its value to $1$ at the end of calculations. The 
reason for doing this is to write the dynamical zeta function 
\refeq{e-DynamicalZeta} in the `cycle expansion' form, after grouping its
terms in powers of $z$. For complete binary dynamics, where every binary symbol
sequence is accessible, the cycle expansion reads
\bea
1 / \zeta &=& 1 - t_0 - t_1 - (t_{01} - t_0 t_1 )  \label{e-CycleExpansion} \\
		  && - [(t_{011} - t_{01}t_1) + (t_{001} - t_{01} t_0)] - ... \continue
		  &=& 1 - \sum_f t_f - \sum_n \hat{c}_n \label{e-CurvatureExpansion}.
\eea
Where we labeled each prime cycle by its binary symbol sequence and in 
\refeq{e-CurvatureExpansion} we grouped the contributions to the zeta function
as `fundamental' contributions $t_f$ and `curvature' corrections $c_n$. 
As we have written explicitly in parentheses in \refeq{e-CycleExpansion}, 
curvature corrections appear in `shadowing' combinations where combination of
shorter cycle weights, `pseudocycle' weights, are subtracted by the longer 
cycle weights. Since the cycle weights \refeq{e-DynamicalZeta} already 
decreases exponentially with increasing cycle period, cycle expansion 
\refeq{e-CycleExpansion} converges even faster than exponential when all the 
longer terms of the expansion are shadowed.

For complete binary symbolic dynamics, the only fundamental contributions to
the dynamical zeta function are from the cycles with topological length $1$
and all the longer cycles appear in the shadowing combinations 
\refeq{e-CycleExpansion}. This is not the case for any unimodal map since some 
symbol sequences might be inaccessible and corresponding pseudocycles of 
the cycle expansion \refeq{e-CycleExpansion} fail to appear. However, if the 
symbolic dynamics of a system can be obtained from complete binary set by 
finite number of replacements, then another cycle expansion form can be 
obtained which would be guaranteed to converge super exponentially. Such a 
duality is be obtained when there exists a finite set of `grammar rules'
to the symbolic dynamics that makes some symbol sequences inaccessible, or 
`pruned'. We argued in \refsect{s:numerics} that the Poincar\'e return map for 
the \twomode\ system (\reffig{fig:psectandretmap} (d)) diverges around 
$s \approx 0.98$ and we approximated this map as if its tip is located at the 
furthest ergodically visited point while searching for the \rpo s. In the 
spirit of the discussion of this section, we ask the following question: Can we 
reasonably approximate the map in \reffig{fig:psectandretmap} (d) in such a way 
that corresponding symbolic dynamics has a finite grammar of prunning rules? 
The answer is, fortunately, yes. 

As we have shown in \reffig{fig:psectandretmap} (d) that the cycles \cycle{001} 
and \cycle{011} pass quite close to the tip of the cusp, and approximating this 
map as if its tip located exactly at the point where \cycle{001} cuts gives us 
exactly what we are looking for: a single grammar rule, that is the symbol 
sequence `00' is inaccessible. This can be made rigorous by the help of 
kneading theory, however, the simple result is easy to see from the return map 
in \reffig{fig:psectandretmap} (d): Cover the parts of the return map, which 
are outside the borders set by the red dashed lines, the cycle \cycle{001} and 
then start any point on the LHS of the tip and look at images. You will always 
land on a point on the RHS of the tip, unless you start at the lower left 
corner, exactly on the cycle \cycle{001}. We expect this `finite grammar 
approximation' to be reasonable also because the orbits, which visit outside 
the borders set by \cycle{001} are very unstable, and hence, less 
important for the description of invariant dynamics.

The binary grammar with only rule that forbids repeats of one of the symbols is
known as `golden mean' shift, named after its topological entropy which is 
$\ln (1 + \sqrt{5})/2$. Binary itineraries of golden mean cycles can be easiliy
obtained from the complete binary symbolic dynamics by substitution
$0 \rightarrow 01$ in  the latter. Thus, we can write the dynamical zeta
function for the golden mean pruned symbolic dynamics by replacing $0$s in
\refeq{e-CycleExpansion} by $01$:
\bea
1 / \zeta &=& 1 - t_{01} - t_1 - (t_{011} - t_{01} t_1 ) 
              \label{e-GoldenMeanCycleExpansion}\\
		  && - [(t_{0111} - t_{011}t_1) + (t_{01011} - t_{01} t_{011} ) ] - ... 
          \nonumber
\eea
Note that all the contributions longer than topological length $2$ to the 
golden mean dynamical zeta function are in form of shadowing combinations. We
are going to compare convergence of the cycle averages within and without the 
finite grammar approximation in \refsect{s-NumResults}, but before moving to 
the numerical results, we explain the remaining details of computation.

While dynamical zeta functions are useful for investigating the convergence
properties, they are not exact, and their computational cost is same with
that of the exact spectral determinants. For this reason, we will expand the
spectral determinant \refeq{e-SpectralDeterminant} ordered in the topological
length of cycles and pseudocycles. We start with the following form of the 
spectral determinant \refeq{e-SpectralDeterminant}:
\beq
    \det (s-\Aop) =   \prod_p \exp \left( - \sum_{r=1}^{n_p r < N}
                             \frac{1}{r} \frac{e^{r(\beta \Obser_p - s T_p)}
                                          }{\oneMinJ{r}} z^{n_p r} \right) \, ,
\ee{e-SpectralDeterminantExp}
where, we took the sum over the prime cycles in the exponential out as a 
product, inserted the order tracking term $z$, and truncated the sum over cycle
repeats at the expansion order $N$. For each prime cycle, we compute the sum in 
\refeq{e-SpectralDeterminantExp}, and then expand the exponential upto order 
$N$, and multiply this expansion with the contributions from previous cycles 
and drop terms with order greater than $N$. This way, after setting $z=1$,
we obtain the $N^{th}$ order spectral determinant, which we will denote as 
\beq
    F_N(\beta , s) = 1 - \sum_{n=1}^{N} Q_n(s, \beta ) \, .
    \label{e-NthOrderSpectDet}
\eeq
Remember that we are searching for the eigenvalues $s ( \beta)$ of the \Aop , 
more specifically, we would like to compute the moments \refeq{eq-moments}. 
$s ( \beta)$ are located at the zeros of the spectral determinant, hence they 
satisfy the implicit equation:
\beq
    F_N(\beta, s(\beta )) = 0 \, .
    \label{e-FNimplicit}
\eeq
By taking derivative of \refeq{e-FNimplicit} with respect to $\beta$ and 
applying chain rule we obtain
\beq
    \frac{d s}{d \beta} = - \left. \frac{\partial F}{\partial \beta} \right/
                                     \frac{\partial F}{\partial s}\, .
\eeq
Higher order derivatives yield higher can also be obtained similarly, and 
finally, we define
\beq
	\langle T \rangle_N = \left. \partial F_N / \partial s 
                          \right|_{\beta=0, s=s (0)} \, ,
	\label{eq-Tavg}
\eeq
and write the \cycForm s as
\bea
    \langle \obser \rangle_N &=& - \frac{1}{\langle T \rangle_N} \left.
                              \frac{\partial F_N}{\partial \beta}
                              \right|_{\beta=0, s=s (0)} \, , \label{e-Avga} \\
    \langle (\obser - \langle \obser \rangle )^2 \rangle_N
    &=& - \frac{1}{\langle T \rangle_N} \left. \frac{\partial^2 F_N}{
                        \partial \beta^2} \right|_{\beta=0, s=s (0)} \, 
                        \label{e-Avgsigma} .
\eea
As we mentioned earlier, for the invariant measure we expect $s (0)$ to be $0$,
however, we did not make such substitution in \cycForm s, since in practice, 
our approximation to the spectral determinant is always of a finite precision, 
hence the solution of $F_N(0, s(0)) = 0$ is small, but not exactly $0$. This 
eigenvalue has a special meaning: It indicates how well the \po s cover the 
strange attractor. Following this interpretation, we define $\gamma = - s(0)$ 
as the `escape rate': the rate at which the dynamics escape the region that is
covered by the \po s. Specifically for our finite grammar approximation; the 
escape rate tells us how frequently does the flow visit the part of the 
Poincar\'e map that we cut off within the approximation.

We defined $\langle T \rangle$ in \refeq{eq-Tavg} as a shorthand for a partial
derivative, however, we can also develop and interpretation for it by looking 
at definitions of dynamical zeta function \refeq{e-DynamicalZeta} and the 
spectral determinant \refeq{e-SpectralDeterminant}. In both series, partial 
derivative with respect to $s$ turns them into weighted sum of the cycle 
periods; with this intuition, we define $\langle T \rangle$ as the `mean cycle 
period'.

These final remarks conclude our review of the periodic theory and its 
extension to the equivariant dynamical systems. We are now ready to present 
our numerical results and discuss their quality.

\subsection{Numerical results}
\label{s-NumResults}

We constructed the spectral determinant \refeq{e-NthOrderSpectDet} at different
orders for two observables: phase velocity $\dot{\theta}$ and the leading 
Lyapunov exponent. Remember that $\Obser_p$ appearing in 
\refeq{e-SpectralDeterminantExp} is the integrated observable, so in order to 
obtain the moments of phase velocity and the leading Lyapunov exponent from 
\refeq{e-Avga} and \refeq{e-Avgsigma}, we respectively input 
$\Obser_p = \theta_p$ phase shift of the prime cycle, and 
$\Obser_p = \ln |\Lambda_{p,e}|$ logarithm the expanding Floquet multiplier of 
the prime cycle.

In \refsect{s:visual}, we explained that \SOn{2} phase shifts corresponds to
the drifts in the configuration space, with this in mind, we can relate the
variance of phase velocity to the diffusion these drifts. We define the 
diffusion constantas:
\beq
    D = \frac{1}{2 d} \sigma_{\dot{\theta}}^2
      = \frac{\langle (\dot{\theta} - \langle \dot{\theta} \rangle)^2 
              \rangle}{2} ,
\eeq
where $d=1$ since our configuration space is one dimensional.

\refTab{t-DynamicalAverages} and \reftab{t-DynamicalAveragesNoGrammar} shows
the cycle averages of the escape rate $\gamma$, mean period 
$\langle T \rangle$, leading Lyapunov exponent $\Lyap$, mean phase velocity 
$\langle \dot{\theta} \rangle$ and the diffusion constant $D$ respectively 
within and without the finite grammar approximation. In the latter, we input 
all the \rpo s we have found into the expansion 
\refeq{e-SpectralDeterminantExp}, whereas in the former, we discarded the

We motivated the finite grammar approximation by expecting a faster convergence
due to the nearly exact shadowing combinations of the golden mean zeta function 
\refeq{e-GoldenMeanCycleExpansion} and this claim is clearly supported by the
numbers in \reftab{t-DynamicalAverages} and 
\reftab{t-DynamicalAveragesNoGrammar}. Take, for example, Lyapunov exponent 
which converges with $7$ digit accuracy at the final order in 
\reftab{t-DynamicalAverages} while we have only $4$ digits at this order in 
\reftab{t-DynamicalAveragesNoGrammar}. Other observables compares similarly in 
terms of their convergence in both cases. Note, however, that the escape rate 
in \reftab{t-DynamicalAverages} converges to $\gamma = 0.000727889$, whereas 
in \reftab{t-DynamicalAveragesNoGrammar} it gets smaller and smaller with an 
oscillatory behavior. This is due to the fact that in the finite grammar 
approximation, we neglect a definite piece of attractor that corresponds to the
cusp of the return map in \reffig{fig:psectandretmap} (d), above the part that
is cut by \cycle{001}.

In order to compare with the cycle averages, we numerically estimated the
leading Lyapunov exponent of the \twomode\ system using the method of
Wolf \etal\rf{WolfSwift85}. This procedure was repeated 100 times for
different initial conditions, yielding a mean estimate of
$\Lyap_{Numerical} = 0.1198 \pm 0.0008$. While the finite grammar
estimate $\Lyap_{FG} = 0.1183$ is within $0.6\%$ range of this value,
the full cycle expansion agrees with the numerical estimate. This is not
surprising, since in the finite grammar approximation, we discard the
most unstable cycles, thus, we obtain a slightly smaller Lyapunov
exponent while obtaining a significantly better convergence.
