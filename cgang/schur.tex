\section{Periodic Schur decomposition}
\label{s:schur}

Here we briefly summarize the periodic eigendecomposition\rf{DingCvit14}
needed for evaluation of Floquet multipliers for \twomode\ \po s. Due to
the non-hyperbolicity of the return map of
\reffig{fig:psectandretmap}\,(d), Floquet multipliers can easily differ
by 100s of orders of magnitude even in a model as simple as the \twomode\
system.
    \PC{2014-07-14: cannot find anyplace in the blog numerical value of
    any of the allegedly very large unstable multipliers. $\ExpaEig
    \approx 80,000$ does not seem so large compared to the numerical
    precision? I guess it wshows I did not have to compute them myself
    :)}
