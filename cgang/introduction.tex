\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

Recent experimental observations of \reqva\ in pipe flows have confirmed
predictions based on dynamical systems theory that coherent structures shape 
the \statesp\ of turbulent flows\rf{science04}. Identifying such solutions can lead to a better
understanding of the transition to turbulence in fluid flows and may, in the long-term,
allow the computation of dynamical averages using periodic orbits. In order to
find coherent solutions such as \reqva\ and \rpo s it is essential, as we shall demonstrate, 
to use continuous symmetry reduction.

One well-studied technique for symmetry reduction, which works well for low-dimensional dynamical systems such 
as Lorenz and R\"{o}ssler flows, is to recast the dynamical equations in terms of invariant polynomials\rf{GL-Gil07b}. 
However, establishing an invariant polynomial basis becomes impractical (even computationally) for systems in more than 12 dimensions\rf{gatermannHab}.
The \mslices%
\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000,BeTh04,SiCvi10,FrCv11,atlas12,ACHKW11,BudCvi14},
which we study in detail here, offers a symmetry reduction
scheme applicable to high-dimensional flows like the \NS\ equations.

While the \mslices\ goes back to Cartan\rf{CartanMF}, to the
best to our knowledge, Rowley and Marsden\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000}
were first to apply it to spatially extended nonlinear flows. Rowley
\etal~\rf{rowley_reduction_2003} generalized the reconstruction equations
developed in \refref{rowley_reconstruction_2000} and formulated them using a `rescaled
time' variable. They demonstrated their method by applying it to the one-dimensional \KS\ equation
in a periodic domain and used it to study its dynamics in the neighborhood of a \reqv\ by using the \reqv\ itself as the \slice\ `\template'.  Beyn and
Th\"{u}mmler\rf{BeTh04} applied the \mslices\ to `freeze' spiral
waves in reaction-diffusion systems.
Siminos and Cvitanovi\'{c}\rf{SiCvi10} used the \mslices\ to quotient the \SOn{2} symmetry of
\cLf\ in the chaotic regime and showed that the slice-dependent
singularity of the reconstruction equation causes the reduced flow to make
discontinuous jumps. This singularity was studied in detail by 
Froehlich and Cvitanovi\'{c}\rf{FrCv11} who proposed a solution using multiple `charts' of connected
slices. This approach was applied to \cLf\
by Cvitanovi\'{c} \etal~\rf{atlas12} and to pipe flow by Willis, Cvitanovi\'{c}, and Avila\rf{ACHKW11}. A
recent paper by Budanur \etal\rf{BudCvi14} followed a geometrical approach
and showed that for \SOn{2} a specific choice of a \slice\
\template\ can be used to move the \slice\ singularity to the border of the
symmetry-reduced submanifold and regularize the close-passages to the
singularity by means of a time rescaling. Here, we follow this approach
and apply their method to a 2-mode ODE normal form, which may be
the simplest system with \SOn{2} equivariant dynamics
that exhibits chaos.

In \refSect{s:symm}, we establish the terminology that will be used in the rest
of the paper and formulate the \mslices\ as proposed by Budanur \etal\rf{BudCvi14}.
\refSect{s:twoMode} introduces the \twoMode\ system and its representation
in terms of four real-valued variables. We then present its symmetry-reduced representations
in terms of invariant polynomials and polar coordinates and discuss its dynamics on a \slice. 
In \refSect{s:numerics}, we show how any of these symmetry-reduced representations can be used
to compute the \reqva\ of the system. We then show how the \mslices\ enables the use a Poincar\'e section within the \slice\ to find  \rpo s and construct symbolic dynamics. Finally, \refSect{s:concl} discusses possible applications of the \mslices\ to various spatially extended systems.
