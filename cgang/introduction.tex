\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

Recent, experimental observations of \reqva\ in pipe flows confirmed
predictions based on the dynamical systems theory that coherent structures shape 
the \statesp s of turbulent flows\rf{science04}. Identifying such solutions can lead to a better
understanding of the transition to turbulence in \NS\ and, in the long-term,
computation of dynamical averages over the periodic orbits. In order to
find coherent solutions such as \reqva\ and \rpo s it is essential , as we shall demonstrate, 
to use continuous symmetry reduction.

Symmetry reduction by casting the dynamics in terms of invariant polynomial is a well-studied technique\rf{GL-Gil07b} for low-dimensional dynamical systems such 
as Lorenz and R\"{o}ssler flows. However, establishing an invariants polynomial basis for
systems with continuous symmetries becomes practically incomputable as the system dimension exceeds 12\rf{gatermannHab}.
The \mslices%
\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000,BeTh04,SiCvi10,FrCv11,atlas12,ACHKW11,BudCvi14},
which we study in detail in this paper, offers a symmetry reduction
scheme for high-dimensional flows, such as \NS.

While the method goes back to Cartan\rf{CartanMF}, to the
best to our knowledge Rowley and Marsden\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000}
were first to apply \mslices\ to spatially extended nonlinear flows. Rowley
\etal~\rf{rowley_reduction_2003} generalized the reconstruction equations
in\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000} and formulated them using a `rescaled
time' variable where they demonstrated the method on one-spatial dimension \KS\ system
in a periodic domain, in the neighborhood of a \reqv, picking
the \reqv\ solution as the \slice\ `\template'.  Beyn and
Th\"{u}mmler\rf{BeTh04} applied the method slices to `freeze' the spiral
waves in reaction-diffusion systems.
\refRefs{SiCvi10,FrCv11} used \mslices\ to reduce the \SOn{2} symmetry of
\cLf's chaotic solutions where they showed the slice-dependent
singularity of reconstruction equation causes the reduced flow to make
discontinuous jumps. This singularity is studied in detail in
\refref{FrCv11}, and the solution of using multiple `charts' of connected
slices was proposed, and this approach was applied to \cLf\
in \refref{atlas12} and to pipe flow in \refref{ACHKW11}. In a
recent paper, Budanur \etal\rf{BudCvi14} followed a geometrical approach
and showed, for \SOn{2}, that for a specific choice of a \slice\
\template , one can move the \slice\ singularity to the border of the
symmetry-reduced sub-manifold and regulate the close-passages to the
singularity by means of a time rescaling. Here we follow this approach
and apply the method to a 2-mode \SOn{2} ODE normal form which perhaps is
the simplest system that exhibits chaos with evolution equations
equivariant under continuous \SOn{2} transformations.

In the following section, we start by setting the terminology for the rest
of the paper and formulate the \mslices\ as in \refref{BudCvi14}. In
\refsect{s:twoMode}, we introduce the \twoMode\ system and its representations
in its real valued \statesp , invariant polynomials, polar coordinates and
on a \slice. We then show that one can use either symmetry reduced representation
to compute all \reqva\ of the system. We then find the \rpo s and construct
symbolic dynamics by the help of Poincar\'e sections within the \slice.
We conclude by discussing the possible applications of this method in various
spatially extended systems.
