\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

Experimental observation of the \reqva\ in pipe flows confirmed
the anticipation based on the theories of nonlinear dynamics that the
coherent structures shapes the \statesp s of turbulent
flows\rf{science04}. Finding such solutions can lead to a better
understanding of transition to turbulence in \NS\ and in the long term,
computation of dynamical averages over the periodic orbits. In order to
find the coherent solutions such as \reqva\ and \rpo s an essential step
to take, as we shall demonstrate, is continuous symmetry reduction.

Symmetry reduction by casting solutions on to an invariant polynomial basis
is well studied\rf{GL-Gil07b} for low-dimensional systems such as Lorenz
and R\"{o}ssler, however, invariants of the continuous symmetries becomes
practically incomputable as the system dimension exceeds 12\rf{REFERENCE}.
The \mslices%
\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000,BeTh04,SiCvi10,FrCv11,atlas12,ACHKW11,BudCvi14},
which we study in detail in this paper, offers a symmetry reduction
scheme for high-dimensional flows, such as \NS.

While the method goes back to Cartan\rf{CartanMF}, to the
best to our knowledge Rowley and Marsden\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000}
were first to apply \mslices\ to spatially extended nonlinear flows. Rowley
\etal~\rf{rowley_reduction_2003} generalized the reconstruction equations
in\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000} and formulated them using a `rescaled
time' variable where they demonstrated the method on one-spatial dimension \KS\ system
in a periodic domain, in the neighborhood of a \reqv, picking
the \reqv\ solution as the \slice\ `\template'.  Beyn and
Th\"{u}mmler\rf{BeTh04} applied the method slices to `freeze' the spiral
waves in reaction-diffusion systems.
\refRefs{SiCvi10,FrCv11} used \mslices\ to reduce the \SOn{2} symmetry of
\cLf's chaotic solutions where they showed the slice-dependent
singularity of reconstruction equation causes the reduced flow to make
discontinuous jumps. This singularity is studied in detail in
\refref{FrCv11}, and the solution of using multiple `charts' of connected
slices was proposed, and this approach was applied to \cLf\
in \refref{atlas12} and to pipe flow in \refref{ACHKW11}. In a
recent paper, Budanur \etal\rf{BudCvi14} followed a geometrical approach
and showed, for \SOn{2}, that for a specific choice of a \slice\
\template , one can move the \slice\ singularity to the border of the
symmetry-reduced sub-manifold and regulate the close-passages to the
singularity by means of a time rescaling. Here we follow this approach
and apply the method to a 2-mode \SOn{2} ODE normal form which perhaps is
the simplest system that exhibits chaos with evolution equations
equivariant under continuous \SOn{2} transformations.

In the following section, we start by setting the terminology for the rest
of the paper and formulate the \mslices\ as in \refref{BudCvi14}. In
section \ref{s:twoMode}, we introduce the \twoMode\ system and its representations
in its real valued \statesp , invariant polynomials, polar coordinates and
on a \slice . We then show that one can use either symmetry reduced representation
to compute all \reqva of the system. We then find the \rpo s and construct
symbolic dynamics by the help of Poincar\'e sections within the \slice .
We conclude by discussing the possible applications of this method in various
spatially extended systems.
