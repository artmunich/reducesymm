The basic equivariants include
\beq
  \{{z}_1\,,\overline{z}_1 {z}_2 \}
            \,,\qquad
  \{{z}_2 \,, z_1 \overline{z}_2\}
\,.
\label{Dang86(1.3)PK}
\eeq
We have equations \refeq{eq:DangSO2} for $\{{z}_1\,,\overline{z}_1\,,
{z}_2\,,\overline{z}_2 \}$ but perhaps need equations for the
equivariants \refeq{Dang86(1.3)PK} - have not thought this through.

Differential operators acting on functions defined on a periodic domain
usually diagonalized by representing the solution as a Fourier expansion.
