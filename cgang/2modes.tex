    \begin{abstract}
[...]
Such a representation gives rise to an SO(2)-equivariant dynamical system,
trajectories of which are critically effected by the symmetry related structures
such as \reqva\ and \rpo s; thus, the symmetry reduction holds a crucial role
in understanding the dynamics. Method of slices is a technique for reducing
continuous symmetries where one fixes a particular solution as a template in
the \statesp\ and maps nearby solutions onto the hyperplane that is perpendicular
to the group tangent computed at the template point, by acting on them with
the group action. We demonstrate the method of slices by applying it to
radically simple SO(2)-equivariant models where only two Fourier modes are present.
We describe a general two-mode system of order 3, and discuss its representations
in the SO(2)-equivariant state space, in the polar coordinates, and
in an invariant polynomial basis, which enables us to determine all \reqva\
of the system. We then focus on two examples with topologically
different chaotic dynamics corresponding to two the different choices of
parameters and apply the method of slices on these systems. We show
that one can determine the symbolic dynamics of
all \rpo s of the system by constructing Poincar\'e
return maps on the slice hyperplane. We can visualise each step of the study
without projecting it onto a sub-manifold since the slice hyperplane, for
this four-dimensional case, is three dimensional.

\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

Over the last decade, new insights into the dynamics of  [blah blah]

Our goals here are two-fold:
    \PC{{\bf[2013-10-07]} Burak's and Daniels outline of Das Artikel is
in \reffig{fig:131007outline}.
}
(i)  Illustrate \mslices\ in the lowest\dmn\ setting possible.
(ii) [blah blah].

As a motivation, consider the chaotic dynamics exhibited by the
small-cell \KS\ system studied in \refref{lanCvit07}. Examination of
typical long-time simulations shows that the spatio-temporal chaos arises
from visits to two kinds of unstable patterns, a `central wobble' region
$S_C$, and a symmetric pair of right/left `drifts' $\{S_L,S_R\}$. In
\statesp\ projections orbits stay in one neighborhood for a while, then
hop to another neighborhood, as illustrated in \reffig{f:antlong}. The
strange attractor that they explore is curved and folded in such a way
that a single local linear chart cannot cover the whole attractor,
several charts are needed, as illustrated by \reffig{fig:2ModeAtlas}\,(d).

The \statesp s of \KS\ and fluid-dynamical flows are high\dmn\ and
difficult to visualize, so here we shall illustrate the key ideas by a
much simpler example, the $\SOn{2}$-equivariant  \twoMode\ system.

\section{Continuous Symmetries}
\label{s:symm}

A dynamical system, $\dot{\ssp}=\vel(\ssp)$, is equivariant under a continuous
symmetry transformation
\beq
	\ssp'= \LieEl (\theta) \ssp = \exp\left( \theta \Lg\right)\ssp,
\ee{contSymTrans}
if the equivariance condition \rf{DasBuch}
\beq
  \groupTan(\vel)  - \Mvar(\ssp) \, \groupTan(\ssp) =0
  \,,
\ee{inftmInv}
is satisfied for every point of the \statesp . In equations \refeq{contSymTrans} and \refeq{inftmInv},
$\LieEl (\theta)$ is the Lie group element, $\Lg$ is the Lie algebra generator,
$\Mvar(\ssp)_{ij} = {\pde \vel_i}/{\pde\ssp_j} |_x$  is the \stabmat ,
$ \groupTan(\ssp) = \Lg \ssp $ is the group tangent evaluated at the point $\ssp$ ,
and $ \groupTan(\vel) = \Lg \vel(\ssp) $ is the group tangent for the velocity
vector evaluated at \ssp .

\subsection{\Reqva\ and \rpo s}
\label{s:relatives}

If the orbit of a point $\ssp_\stagn$ coincides with its group orbit,
namely if one can find a group parameter $\theta (t)$, for every point $\ssp (t)$
on the orbit of $\ssp_\stagn$ such that
\beq
  \ssp (t) = \ssp_\stagn + \int_0^t d\tau \vel(\ssp (\tau)) = \LieEl (\theta (t)) \ssp_\stagn
  \,
\ee{releq}
is satisfied, the $\ssp_\stagn$ is called a \reqv . By expanding both sides of \refeq{releq}
for infinitesimal time, we can get the relation $\vel(\ssp_\stagn) = \dot{\theta}(\ssp_\stagn) \Lg \ssp_\stagn$,
and since this has to hold for every point on the group orbit of $\ssp_\stagn$
we deduce that $\dot{\theta} = c$ is a constant. We now can multiply the equivariance
condition \refeq{inftmInv} evaluated at the \reqv\ by $c$ and write the
\reqv\ condition compactly as
\beq
(\velRel \Lg - \Mvar ) \vel (\ssp_\stagn) =0
\,.
\ee{ReqvMargEig}
The constant group parameter velocity $c$  is called the \phaseVel .

Similar to the \reqv\ condition \refeq{releq}, \rpo\ condition for a \statesp\ point can be written as
\beq
  \ssp (T) = \ssp_\rpprime  + \int_0^T d\tau \vel(\ssp (\tau)) = \LieEl (\theta_\rpprime ) \ssp_\rpprime
  \,,
\ee{relpo}
meaning that the trajectory of $\ssp_\rpprime$ intersects its group orbit at
time $T$. While the trajectory of a \rpo\ traces out the same path shifted
by the group action over and over again, as we shall see in the examples of
\ref{s:twoModeSymRed}, it can be extremely complicated if the continuous
symmetry of the system is not reduced.

\subsection{Symmetry reduction by the \mslices}
\label{s:slice}

Basic idea of the \mslices\ is picking a particular \statesp\ point as a \template\
($\slicep$) and expressing solutions as reduced trajectories ($\sspRed (t)$) on the hyperplane
(\pSRed) that involves the \template\ ($\slicep$) and is perpendicular to the group
tangent evaluated at the \template\ ($\sliceTan{} = \groupTan(\slicep) = \Lg \slicep$),
while keeping record of the group parameter $\theta (t)$, that maps the solution
back to the symmetry equivariant \statesp . This idea is illustrated in \reffig{fig:ReducTraj1}.

neighborhood of $\slicep$.  The full
\statesp\ trajectory $\ssp(\tau)$ and the \reducedsp\

$\pS_{\ssp(\tau)}$ and are equivalent up to a group rotation
$\LieEl(\gSpace)$ %, defined in   refeq{sspOrbit}
(from \wwwcb{}).

\end{figure}

Reduced trajectories $\sspRed (t)$, can be obtained in two ways. In the first
method, one takes the symmetry equivariant data and looks for the time dependent
group parameter ($\theta (t)$) for which the group operation transforms the
$\ssp (t)$ to $\sspRed (t) = \LieEl(- \theta (t)) \ssp (t)$ that satisfies
the \slice\ condition:
\beq
(\sspRed(t) - \slicep)\cdot \sliceTan{} = 0
\,.
\ee{SliceCond}
This is a post-processing method and is applicable to both numerical and
experimental data, however, as one has to perform a Newton search for
every point in the data set, is computationally heavier than  the second method.
The second method is computing the reduced trajectory $\sspRed (t)$ and the
time dependent group parameter $\theta (t)$ directly by integrating
\bea
\velRed(\sspRed) &=& \vel(\sspRed)
   -\dot{\theta}(\sspRed) \, \groupTan(\sspRed)
\continue
\dot{\theta}(\sspRed) &=& {\braket{\vel(\sspRed)}{\sliceTan{}}}/
               {\braket{\groupTan(\sspRed)}{\sliceTan{}}}
\,.
\label{eq:so2reduced}
\eea
Here, $\velRed$ is the projection of the velocity function on the \slicePlane .
For a detailed derivation of \refeq{eq:so2reduced}, see \refref{DasBuch}.
Note that the time derivative of the group parameter, which appears also
in the reduced velocity function, becomes singular if the dot product $\braket{\groupTan(\sspRed)}{\sliceTan{}}$
is zero. When this happens, the reduced trajectory becomes discontinuous and
no longer useful. The set of points whithin a \slicePlane\ which satisfies
\beq
\braket{\groupTan(\sspRed^*)}{\sliceTan{}} = 0
\,
\ee{ChartBordCond}
is called the \chartBord . In general, \chartBord\ can be avoided by use of
multiple \template s and arranging them in a way that the trajectories do not
intersect the \chartBord , as done in \refref{atlas12}. In the particular
case of the \twoMode\ system that we study in this paper, we can describe
the reduced dynamics using a single \slice\ by picking a \template\ for which
the \chartBord\ is a flow invariant subspace, hence never visited.

If a $d$\dmn\ dynamical flow is $\Group$-equivariant under actions of
an $N$ continuous parameters symmetry group $\Group$, its $d$\dmn\ \statesp\ is foliated
by $N$\dmn\ group orbits, and the symmetry-\reducedsp\
$\pS/\Group$ is $(d\!-\!N)$\dmn.
The simplest continuous symmetry groups are the 1-parameter compact rotation
group $\SOn{2}$ and the 1-parameter noncompact translation group
$T(1)$; here we shall focus on the $\SOn{2}$ case.

In order to construct a representation for $\SOn{2}$ let us take a Fourier 
series expansion of a real valued smooth periodic function:
\beq
	u(\phi) = a_0 + \sum\limits_{k=- \infty}^\infty a_k e^{i k \phi} .
\ee{FourierSeries}
We can write the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier coefficients with
$k \geq 1$ in a state vector $(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2,..., x_m, y_m)$ where
$a_i = x_i + i y_i$ and represent the $\SOn{2}$ group action on this vector
as a block diagonal matrix:

	 %\LieEl (\theta)= \\ 
					  %\begin{pmatrix}
					  %\cos \theta & \sin \theta & 0               & 0              & \cdots & 0              & 0               \\
					 %-\sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0               & 0              & \cdots & 0              & 0               \\

\ee{mmodeLieEl}
where,
\beq
	R(n \theta) =	\begin{pmatrix}
					\cos n \theta & \sin n \theta \\
					-\sin n \theta & \cos n \theta
					\end{pmatrix} ,
\ee{rotationmatrix}
are modulated rotation matrices. In this representation, the Lie algebra generator is
\beq
	 \Lg =  \begin{pmatrix}
			 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
			-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
			 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\

			 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & m \\
			 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots &-m & 0  
			 \end{pmatrix} .
\ee{mmodeLg}
Now let us consider the following specific choice of a \slice\ \template\:
\beq
	\slicep = (1, 0, ..., 0) .
\ee{firstmodetemp}
Points on the hyperplane defined by this template \refeq{slicetemp} and its
group tangent ($ \sliceTan{} = \Lg \slicep $) through the equation \refeq{SliceCond}
are of the following form:
\beq
	\sspRed = (\hat{x}_1, 0, \hat{x}_2, \hat{y}_2, ..., \hat{x}_m, \hat{y}_m) .
\ee{slicetemp}
And they satisfy the \chartBord\ condition \refeq{ChartBordCond} only if 
$\hat{x}_1 = 0$, in other words, as long as the first mode magnitude is non zero,
there is a corresponding point to every group orbit on the \slicePlane\ 
defined by \refeq{firstmodetemp}. We pick the \slice\ \template\ \refeq{firstmodetemp} 
for computational convenience, in general, any first mode template $\slicep = (x_1, y_1, 0,...,0)$
would do as good since the first mode has the symmetry of a circle. We also 
restrict the \slicePlane\ to the half-space where $x_1 > 0$ to have a unique 
representative point for each group orbit since otherwise each group orbit
pierces the \slicePlane\ twice. These concepts are illustrated in \reffig{fig:BBgorbitsandslice}

\refFig{fig:BBgorbitsandslice} shows a 3D projection of the 4D \statesp\ corresponding
to an $m=2$ truncation of \refeq{FourierSeries}, for which \refeq{mmodeLieEl} and \refeq{mmodeLg}
are $4 \times 4$ matrices. The \slicePlane\ defined by \refeq{firstmodetemp}, three 
different group orbits and the group tangents evaluated at their intersections with the \slicePlane\ 
are visualized in \reffig{fig:BBgorbitsandslice}. One can see as the magnitude of the second mode (the vertical axis) 
relative to the first mode increases, the group tangent gets closer to being 
parallel to the \slicePlane , however, it still has a non zero perpendicular component. The vertical
axis ($x_2$ in \reffig{fig:BBgorbitsandslice} lies on the \chartBord\ of the
\slicePlane . 

In the next section, we will introduce a dynamical system with the \statesp\ 
geometry of \reffig{fig:BBgorbitsandslice} and analyze its symmetry reduced
dynamics within the \slicePlane\ defined by a \template\ \refeq{slicetemp}

\section{\twoMode\ $\SOn{2}$-equivariant flow}
\label{s:twoMode}

Dangelmayr,\rf{Dang86} Armbruster, Guckenheimer and Holmes,\rf{AGHO288}
Jones and Proctor,\rf{JoPro87} and Porter and Knobloch\rf{PoKno05} (see
Golubitsky \etal\rf{golubII}, Sect. XX.1) have investigated bifurcations
in 1:2 resonance ODE normal form models to third order in the amplitudes.
Our starting point is such a model
that we shall refer to as the {\twoMode} system:
\bea
	\dot{z}_1 &=& (\mu_1-\ii\, e_1)\,z_1+a_1\,z_1|z_1|^2
				 +b_1\,z_1|z_2|^2+c_1\,\overline{z}_1\,z_2
	\continue
	\dot{z}_2 &=& (\mu_2-\ii\, e_2)\,{z_2}+a_2\,z_2|z_1|^2
				 +b_2\,z_2|z_2|^2+c_2\,z_1^2 \,,
	\label{eq:DangSO2}
\eea
with $z_1,\,z_2$  complex, and all parameters real valued. The complex
\twoMode\ system \refeq{eq:DangSO2} may be rewritten as a 4-dimensional
first order ODE system,
by substitution $z_1 = x_1 + i\,y_1$, $z_2 = x_2 + i\,y_2$,
\bea
\dot{x}_1 &=& (\mu_1 + a_1 r_1^2 + b_1 r_2^2 + c_1 x_2)x_1 + c_1 y_1 y_2 + e_1 y_1
\continue
\dot{y}_1 &=& (\mu_1 + a_1 r_1^2 + b_1 r_2^2 - c_1 x_2)y_1 + c_1 x_1 y_2 - e_1 x_1
\continue
\dot{x}_2 &=& (\mu_2 + a_2 r_1^2 + b_2 r_2^2)x_2 + c_2 (x_1^2 - y_1^2) + e_2 y_2
\continue
\dot{y}_2 &=& (\mu_2 + a_2 r_1^2 + b_2 r_2^2)y_2 + 2 c_2 x_1 y_1 - e_2 x_2
\continue
		  && \mbox{where } r_1^2 = x_1^2 + y_1^2\, , \quad r_2^2 = x_2^2 + y_2^2
\,.
\label{2mode4D}
\eea
As our goal is only to
illustrate and compare continuous symmetry reduction schemes, we shall
study here several simplified versions of model \refeq{2mode4D}, in
the dimensionally lowest possible setting, with the full \statesp\ of
dimension $d=4$, and the $\SOn{2}$-reduced dynamics taking place in 3
dimensions. For these models the
parameters are far from the bifurcation values, and have no
physical interpretation.

It can be checked by inspection that equations \refeq{eq:DangSO2} are
equivariant under the \Un{1}\ transformation
\beq
(z_1,z_2) \rightarrow   (e^{i {\gSpace}}z_1,e^{i 2{\gSpace}} z_2)
\,.
\ee{Dang86(1.1)aa}
In the real representation \refeq{2mode4D}, the $\SOn{2}$ group action
\refeq{Dang86(1.1)aa} is given by $\ssp'= \exp\left( \theta \Lg\right)\ssp$,
where $\transp{\ssp} = \{ x_1, y_1,x_2, y_2\}$, and $\Lg$ is the Lie algebra
generator
\beq
\Lg  \, =
\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
         0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
        -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
         0 & 0 & 0 & 2\\
         0 & 0 & -2 & 0
      \end{array} \right)
\,.
\ee{LGTwoMode}
One can easily check that the real \twoMode\ system \refeq{2mode4D}
satisfies the equivariance condition \refeq{inftmInv}.

The parameters $\{e_1,e_2\}$ break the $\On{2}$ symmetry of the
Dangelmayr normal form system\rf{Dang86} to an $\SOn{2}$-equivariant
system. As we show in \refeq{PKinvEqs1} below, only the combination
$(2e_1-e_2)$ matters, so for simplicity we set $e_1=0$.

From \refeq{eq:DangSO2} we note that the \eqv\ point \((z_1,z_2)=(0,0)\)
is an invariant subspace, and that $z_1=0$, $z_2 \neq 0$ is a 2\dmn\
flow-invariant subspace,
\beq
  \dot{z}_1 = 0
\,,\qquad
  \dot{z}_2 = (\mu_2-\ii\, e_2 +b_2 |z_2|^2)\,{z_2}
\,,
\ee{eq:DangSO2spsp}
with a single circular \reqv\ of radius $r_2 = \norm{z_2} = \sqrt{-\mu_2/b_2}$ with
\phaseVel\ $\velRel=e_2$.
    \PC{recheck: is $\velRel=e_2$? \BBedit{I confirm.}}
At the origin $\Mvar$ commutes with $\Lg$, and thus can be block-diagonalized
into two $[2\!\times\!2]$ matrices.
% According to {\bf [2012-04-27 Daniel]},
The $[0,0,0,0]$ \eqv\ eigenvalues are $\lambda_1 = \mu_1$ with multiplicity 2 and
             $\lambda_3 = \mu_2 \pm i e_2$. The eigenvectors for
             $\lambda_1$ are $(1,0,0,0)$ and $(0,1,0,0)$ in the
             $(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2)$ basis.
             The eigenvectors for
             $\lambda_2$ are $(0,0,1,0)$ and $(0,0,0,1)$



By contrast, for $c_2 \neq 0$, $z_2 =0$ is not a flow-invariant subspace,
as the flow exits the $z_2 =0$ plane,
    \PC{should we check if anything of interest happens for $c_2 = 0$? }
\[
  \dot{z}_1 = (\mu_1-\ii\, e_1)\,z_1+a_1\,z_1|z_1|^2

One can now either investigate the dynamics in this invariant basis or
plot the `image'\rf{GL-Gil07b} of solutions computed in the equivariant
basis \refeq{eq:DangSO2} in terms of invariant polynomials
\refeq{Dang86(1.2)PK}.

%\item[2012-04-29 Predrag]
For the 4\dmn\ model at hand we find the invariant polynomials \refeq{PKinvEqs1}
and the polar coordinates \refeq{Dang86(1.2)polar} very useful for cross-checking the
full \statesp\ $\transp{\ssp} = \{ x_1, x_2,y_1, y_2\}$ calculations.
But even
for the simplest conceivable $\SOn{2}$ 4-dimensional flow their
construction requires a bit of algebra, and we do not know
how to carry out such constructions for very high\dmn\ flows,
such as the \KS\ flow, and the Navier-Stokes flow.


\subsection{\Eqva\ of the symmetry-reduced dynamics}
\label{s:eqva}

The first step in elucidating the geometry of attracting
sets is a determination of their \eqva. For the flows
with velocity fields of multinomial form, the \eqv\
condition $\dot{\sspRed}=0$ reduces to finding roots of
multinomials. We shall now show that the symmetry-reduced
{\twoMode} system
\refeq{PKinvEqs1} has 8 \eqva, real or complex pairs.
%[2012-04-28 Predrag]

\beq
A_1= \mu_1+a_1\,u+b_1\,v
    \,,\qquad
A_2 = \mu_2+a_2\,u+b_2\,v

then rewrite \refeq{PKinvEqs1} as

\nnu
\eea
We already know $[0,0,0,0]$ and $[0,-\mu_2/b_2,0,0]$ roots, so we are looking only
for the $u>0$, $v>0$, $w,q \in \reals$ solutions; there could be problems
from the non-generic roots with either $w=0$ or $q=0$, but not both
simultaneously, syzygy \refeq{eq:syzPK} precludes that. $w$ and/or $q$
can be eliminated by obtaining the following relations from \refeq{PKinvEqs3}:
\bea
	w  &=& - \frac{2\,u}{c_1}\,A_1 = - \frac{2\,v}{c_2}\,A_2
	\continue
	q &=& \frac{2(-2e_1+\,e_2)\,u\,v}{c_2\,u+2\,c_1\,v} .

polynomials roots of which are the \eqva\ of the system \refeq{PKinvEqs1}:

We divide the common multiplier $u^2$ from the second equation and by doing
so, eliminate one of the roots at the origin (there still is another root at
the origin), and the $[0,-\mu_2/b_2,0,0]$ root from the equations. Furthermore, 
we scale the parameters and variables as
$\tilde{u} = c_2\,u$,
$\tilde{v} = c_1\,v$,
$\tilde{a_1} = a_1/c_2$,
$\tilde{b_1} = b_1/c_1$,
$\tilde{a_2} = a_2/c_2$,
$\tilde{b_2} = b_2/c_1$,
to finally get
\bea

In order to find \reqva\ of the \twoMode\ system, one has to solve two bivariate
polynomials \refeq{PKinvEqs5a} which, in general, is not a trivial task. However,
as we shall see in the examples of the next section, for particular choices
of parameters, equations\refeq{PKinvEqs5a} symplify significantly allowing
us to determine all \reqva\ of the \twoMode\ system.

\subsection{Reduction of $\SOn{2}$ symmetry of the \twoMode\ system using
\mslices}
\label{s:twoModeSymRed}

To illustrate the \mslices\ on the \twoMode\ system we choose two relatively
simple sets of parameters for which we observe interesting dynamics. These
parameters are listed in table \ref{tab:pars}. Note for both sets, we choose
$b_2 = 0$ and by doing so, we send the \reqv\ at $[0,-\mu_2/b_2,0,0]$ to infinity
and simplify the bivariate polynomials \refeq{PKinvEqs5a} such that from the
first equation \refeq{PKinvEqs5a} we can get the condition $\tilde{v} = (\mu_1 + \tilde{a}_1 \tilde{u})/
(\mu_2 + \tilde{a}_2 \tilde{u} - \tilde{u} \tilde{b}_1)$ and substitute into
the \refeq{PKinvEqs5b} to solve for single variable.

	\caption{Parameter sets that we used to study the \twoMode\ system.}
	\label{tab:pars}
\end{table}

We start with the first set of parameters in table \ref{tab:pars}. For this set,
after substituting the parameters with values 1 and 0 into the \refeq{eq:DangSO2},
the simplified \twoMode\ system \refeq{eq:DangSO2} has 3-parameters $\{ \mu_1, c_2, a_2 \}$:
\bea
\label{eq:DangSO2set1}

\,,
\eea
By solving the polynomials \refeq{PKinvEqs5} with the parameter set 1 from \ref{tab:pars},
we get the \eqva\ of the system in the invariant polynomial basis \refeq{Dang86(1.2)PK} as

Among these roots, only the origin and the second root has a correspondance
in the $\SOn{2}$-equivariant \statesp\ as \eqv\ and \reqv\ respectively.

Starting close to the relative equilibrium $x_0 = (0.439966, 0, 0.386267, 0.070204)$
corresponding to the second root in \refeq{eq:eqvaset1} we integrate the $\SOn{2}$-equivariant
equations \refeq{2mode4D} for 500 time units and plot two projections of the 4D

reduction techniques, we plotted the corresponding flow in the invariant polynomial
basis on \reffig{fig:Set1}(c) and the symmetry reduced flow using \mslices\
on \reffig{fig:Set1}(d). While \reffig{fig:Set1}(c) is generated by simply
integrating \refeq{PKinvEqs1}, we obtained \reffig{fig:Set1}(d) by integrating
\refeq{eq:so2reduced} within the \slicePlane\ of the \template ,
\beq

  \item
        compute analytically the \stabmat\ \Mvar\ in polar coordinates
  \item
        Study eigenvalues, keep playing with parameters. We would like
        -preferably- no \reqv\ to be attracting limit cycle, and several of
        the \reqva\ to be complex-pair unstable, leading to chaos, to be
        visualized and sliced in Cartesian coordinates.
  \item
        If you find a nice chaotic attractors, others can join in
        constructing an atlas for it. We just need one and only one
        example with non-trivial \chartBord s and at least 2 charts.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\REQV{}{1} = (r_1,r_2,\psi)=(0.0516508, 1.26311,?)$ and
        $\REQV{}{2} = (0.467095,0.2146,?)$
  \item their plots in the Cartesian coordinates
  \item $\dot{\theta}$ to see how slow/fast are they. $\dot{\theta}$
        might be related to 4th eigenvalue, when you go back
        to Cartesian coordinates
  \item stability eigenvalues, eigenvectors of the \eqv\ $\EQV{0}$ at
        origin, at your parameter values - if it is stable, everything
        just might fall into it and die.
  \item plots of small perturbations of the above \eqv\ and \reqva\ in
        the Cartesian coordinates to see whether the dynamics looks
        chaotic
  \item $\REQV{}{1}$: 2 large positive eigenvalues looks scary - probably
        nothing re-visits this \reqv. A mildly unstable complex pair
        would have been sweeter. You get complex eigenvalue by Hopf-bifurcating off a
        stable orbit, typically.
  \item $\REQV{}{1}$: Does either unstable eigenvalue become a complex
        eigenvalue pair in Cartesian coordinates?
  \item $\REQV{}{2}$: contracting eigenvalues have very small imaginary
        part, so the presumably just rocket toward the \reqv, not much
        spiraling there. At least the unstable eigenvalue seems slow
        compared to all other eigenvalues.
  \item $\REQV{}{1}$: Does the unstable eigenvalue become a complex
        eigenvalue pair in Cartesian coordinates?
\end{itemize}

\section{Chart}
\label{s:slice}

 [blah blah]

One can write the equations for the flow in the \reducedsp\
$\dot{\sspRed} = \velRed(\sspRed)$ (for details see, for example,
\refref{DasBuch}) as
\bea
\velRed(\sspRed) &=& \vel(\sspRed)
     \,-\, \dot{\gSpace}(\sspRed) \, \groupTan(\sspRed)
\label{2modesEqMotMFrame}\\
\dot{\gSpace}(\sspRed) &=& \braket{\vel(\sspRed)}{\sliceTan{}}
                       /\braket{\groupTan(\sspRed)}{\sliceTan{}}
\,
\label{2modesreconstrEq}
\eea
which confines the motion to the \slice\ hyperplane. Thus, the dynamical
system $\{\pS,\map^t\}$ with continuous symmetry \Group\ is replaced by
the {\reducedsp} dynamics $\{\pSRed,\mapRed^t\}$: The velocity in the
full \statesp\ $\vel$ is the sum of $\velRed$, the velocity component in
the \slice\ hyperplane, and $\dot{\gSpace}\,\groupTan$, the velocity
component along the group tangent space. The integral of the {\em
reconstruction equation} for $\dot{\gSpace}$ keeps track of the group
shift in the full \statesp.
