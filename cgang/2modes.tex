\begin{abstract}
Dynamical systems with translational or rotational symmetry arise
frequently in studies of spatially extended physical systems, such as
Navier-Stokes flows on periodic domains. In these cases, it is natural to
express a state of the fluid in terms of a Fourier series truncated to a
finite number of modes. Here we study a 4-dimensional two-mode
SO(2)-equivariant model of this type, the smallest possible truncation
that retains the symmetry while remaining high-dimensional enough to
allow for chaotic dynamics. A crucial step in analysis of such a system
is symmetry reduction. We use the model to illustrate different
symmetry-reduction schemes. Its relative equilibria are conveniently
determined by rewriting the dynamics in terms of a symmetry-invariant
polynomial basis. However, for study of chaotic dynamics, the `method of
slices', applicable also to very high-dimensional problems, is
preferable. We show that a Poincar\'e section within the `slice' can be
used to further reduce this flow to what is for all practical purposes a
unimodal map. This enables us to systematically determine all relative
periodic orbits and their symbolic dynamics up to any desired period. We
then compute several dynamical averages using relative periodic orbits
and discuss the convergence of such computations.

\begin{quotation}
Periodic orbit theory provides a way to compute dynamical averages for
chaotic flows by means of {\cycForm s} that relate the time averages of
observables to the spectra of unstable periodic orbits. Standard
{\cycForm s} are valid under the assumption that the stability
multipliers of all periodic orbits have a single marginal direction
corresponding to time evolution, and are hyperbolic in all other
directions. However, if a dynamical system has $N$ continuous symmetries,
periodic orbits are replaced by relative periodic orbits, invariant
$(N+1)$-dimensional tori with marginal stability in $(N+1)$ directions.
These exact invariant solutions arise in studies of turbulent flows, such
as the pipe flow or the plane Couette flow, where the translational
symmetries of the flow are approximated by carrying out simulations in
periodic domains. A state of the fluid can then be expressed as a Fourier
series, truncated to a large but finite (from tens to thousands) set of
Fourier modes. This paper is a tutorial on how such problems are to be
analyzed using periodic orbit theory. We illustrate all steps of
\rpo s analysis on what is arguably the simplest such dynamical system, a
`\twomode' model.

\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

Recent experimental observations of travelling waves in pipe flows have
confirmed dynamical systems theory intuition that the invariant solutions
of \NSe\ play an important role in shaping the \statesp\ of turbulent
flows\rf{science04}. When one recasts fluid flow equations in a
particular basis, the outcome is an infinite dimensional dynamical system
that is often equivariant under transformations such as
translations, reflections and rotations. For example, when a periodic
boundary condition is imposed along the streamwise direction, equations
for pipe flow retain their form under streamwise translations, azimuthal
rotations and reflections about the central axis, \ie, they are invariant
under the actions of $\SOn{2} \times \On{2}$. In that case it is natural
that the states of the fluid be expressed in a Fourier basis. However,
as the system evolves the nonlinear terms in the equations mix the
Fourier modes, and thus the state of the system evolves both along
symmetry directions and directions transverse to them.
This phenomenon in dynamical systems with continuous symmetries
complicates their \statesp, and gives rise to the high dimensional coherent
solutions such as \reqva\ and \rpo s, which take on the roles played by
\eqva\ and \po s in flows without symmetry.

This paper is a tutorial that works through an example in order to
illustrate step-by-step how periodic orbit theory is applied to flows
with continuous symmetries, an analysis that should ultimately be applied
to turbulent flows, once sufficiently many exact invariant solutions
become numerically accessible. For this purpose, we study a \twomode\
\SOn{2} equivariant flow, of minimal dimensionality required for chaotic
dynamics. The paper is organized as follows: In \refsect{s:symm} we
define basic concepts and briefly review the relevant symmetry reduction
literature. In \refsect{s:twoMode}, we introduce the \twomode\ model
system, describe several of its representations, and utilize a
symmetry-reduced polynomial representation to find the only \reqv\ of the
system. In \refsect{s:numerics}, we show how the \mslices\ can be used to
quotient the symmetry and reduce the dynamics onto a symmetry-reduced
\statesp, or `\slice'. A Poincar\'e section within the \slice\ then
reduces the 4\dmn\ chaotic dynamics in the full \statesp\ to a
1-dimensional unimodal Poincar\'e return map. This return map is then
used to construct a finite grammar symbolic dynamics for the flow, and
determine {\em all} \rpo s up to a given period. In \refsect{s:DynAvers},
these orbits are used as input to various {\cycForm s} in order to calculate
dynamically interesting observables. In \refsect{s:concl},
we discuss possible applications of the \mslices\ to various spatially
extended systems.
\refAppe{s:newton} describes the multi-shooting method used to calculate
the \rpo s.
\refAppe{s:schur} discusses how periodic Schur decomposition can be used
to determine their Floquet multipliers, which can easily differ by 100s
of orders of magnitude even in a model as simple as the \twomode\ system.
