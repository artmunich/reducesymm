\section{Conclusions}
\label{s:concl}

We have shown how one applies the periodic orbit theory to a dynamical
system with a continuous $\SOn{2}$ symmetry. The steps outlined in this
tutorial are, in principle, applicable to physical systems that are
described by $N$-Fourier mode truncations of PDEs such as $1D$
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\rf{SCD09b}, $3D$ pipe flows\rf{WiShCv14}, etc.
Awaiting challenges are reduction of the discrete symmetries of such
systems along with the continuous $\SOn{2}$ symmetry, and finding
symbolic dynamics.
