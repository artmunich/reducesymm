\section{Conclusions}
\label{s:concl}
We applied the periodic orbit theory to a dynamical system with a continuous $\SOn{2}$ symmetry using its \rpo s. The steps outlined in this paper are, in principle, applicable to physical systems that are described by $N$-Fourier modes truncations of PDEs such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, pipe flows, etc. Avaiting challenges are reduction of the discrete symmetries of such systems along with the continuous $\SOn{2}$ symmetry, and finding symbolic dynamics.
