State-space geometry of a Kuramoto-Sivashinsky flow in terms of
relative periodic orbits

The long-time dynamics of a chaotic
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky flow on a periodic domain is organized by its
unstable equilibria, traveling waves, periodic and relative periodic
orbits and their stable/unstable manifolds. Quotienting by the
O(2) continuous symmetry renders relative periodic orbits periodic, 
reducing dynamics to mappings between a set of Poincare sections. 
The hierarchy of periodic orbits so obtained enables us to calculate 
long-time averages  of physical quantities such as  dissipation rates.
