Spatiotemporal dynamics and phase-space geometry of a 
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky flow in terms of unstable relative periodic
orbits

We study the dynamics of a chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky flow with periodic boundary conditions. The asymptotic dynamics is organized by unstable equilibria, relative equilibria, periodic and relative periodic orbits. We propose a description of the dynamics in terms of maps between local Poincar\'e sections attached to the important invariant solutions. We use the hierarchy of periodic and relative periodic orbits to calculate asymptotic averages for the system by means of cycle expansions.
