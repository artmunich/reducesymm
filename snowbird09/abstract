Spatiotemporal dynamics and phase-space geometry of a 
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky flow in terms of unstable relative periodic
orbits

We study the dynamics of a small-cell, chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky flow in
periodic domain. The asymptotic dynamics
is organized by unstable equilibria, periodic orbits and, due to
continuous translational symmetry, by relative equilibria and relative
periodic orbits. We develop an understanding of the dynamics in terms
of discrete maps between local Poincare sections attached to the important
invariant solutions. We use the hierarhy of periodic and relative
periodic orbits to calculate asymptotic averages for the system by means of cycle expansions.
