These periodic orbits correspond to trajectories on the full phase space which are not necessarily periodic, but whose end points are related by symmetry.
  Examples: the stadium billiard, a particle in a periodic potential, the Sinai billiard, the quartic oscillator, and the rotational spectrum of SF6.},

  abstract = {
generalizations of the trace formula valid in the presence of a non-Abelian continuous symmetry. The usual trace formula must be modified in such cases because periodic orbits occur in continuous families, whereas the usual trace formula requires that the periodic orbits be isolated at a given energy. These calculations extend the results of a previous paper, in which they considered Abelian continuous symmetries. The most important application of the results is to systems with full three-dimensional rotational symmetry, and they give this case special consideration.

  title={Semiclassical mechanics of symmetry reduction},
  journal={Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General},
  volume={26},
  pages={95-118},
  url={http://stacks.iop.org/0305-4470/26/95},
  year={1993},
  abstract={The author discusses semiclassical approximations that are adapted to given symmetry classes in quantum mechanics. Arbitrary abelian symmetries and also rotational symmetry are treated. Semiclassical approximations are derived for the projected propagator and energy dependent Green's function associated with a given irreducible representation of the symmetry group. From these they derive trace formulae, analogous to the usual trace formula, that determine the energy levels in a given symmetry class in terms of classical orbits. }

semiclassical trace formula for a symmetry-reduced part of the spectrum in axially symmetric systems. The classical orbits that contribute are closed in (?,z,p?,pz) and have

For $m \neq 0$,
these orbits vary with energy and almost never lie on periodic trajectories in the full phase space in contrast to the case of discrete symmetries.
