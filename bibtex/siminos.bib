	title = {On the integrability and perturbation of three-dimensional
             fluid flows with symmetry},
	volume = {4},
	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to develop
analytical methods for studyingparticle paths in a class of
three-dimensional incompressible fluid flows. In this paper we
study three-dimensionalvolume preserving vector fields that are
invariant under the action of a one-parameter symmetry group
whose infinitesimal generator is autonomous and
volume-preserving. We show that there exists a coordinate
system in which the vector field assumes a simple form. In
particular, the evolution of two of the coordinates is governed
by a time-dependent, one-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system
with the evolution of the remaining coordinate being governed
by a first-order differential equation that depends only on the
other two coordinates and time. The new coordinates depend only
on the symmetry group of the vector field. Therefore they
arefield-independent. The coordinate transformation is
constructive. If the vector field is time-independent, then it
possesses an integral of motion. Moreover, we show that the
system can be further reduced toaction-angle-angle coordinates.
These are analogous to the familiar action-angle variables from
Hamiltonian mechanics and are quite useful for perturbative
studies of the class of systems we consider. In fact, we show
how our coordinate transformation puts us in a position to
apply recent extensions of the {Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser}
{(KAM)} theorem for three-dimensional, volume-preserving maps
as well as three-dimensional versions of Melnikov's method. We
discuss the integrability of the class of flows considered, and
draw an analogy with Clebsch variables in fluid mechanics.},

	abstract = {The {Oberbeck-Boussinesq} equations are reduced
to a two-dimensional form governing convection
between two free surfaces maintained at a constant temperature
difference. These equations are then transformed to a set of
ordinary differential equations governing the time variations
of the {double-Fourier} coefficients for the motion and
temperature fields. Non-linear transfer processes are retained
and appear as quadratic interactions between the Fourier
coefficients. Energy and heat transfer relations appropriate to
this Fourier resolution, and a numerical method for solution
from arbitrary initial conditions are given. As examples of the
method, numerical solutions for a highly truncated Fourier
representation are presented. These solutions, which are for a
fixed Prandtl number and variable Rayleigh numbers, show the
transient growth of convection from small perturbations, and in
all cases studied approach steady states. The steady states
obtained agree favorably with steady-state solutions obtained
by previous investigators.},

                 most fundamental and longest-standing problems in fluid
                 dynamics. Stability theory suggests that the flow
                 remains laminar for all flow rates, but in practice
                 pipe flow becomes turbulent even at moderate speeds.
                 This transition drastically affects the transport
                 efficiency of mass, momentum, and heat. On the basis of
                 the recent discovery of unstable traveling waves in
                 computational studies of the Navier-Stokes equations
                 and ideas from dynamical systems theory, a model for
                 the transition process has been suggested. We report
                 experimental observation of these traveling waves in
                 pipe flow, confirming the proposed transition scenario
                 and suggesting that the dynamics associated with these
                 unstable states may indeed capture the nature of fluid
                 turbulence.",

This bifurcation is followed by several others giving rise to a
fascinating series of stable and unstable steady states of
different symmetries and wavelengths. First, the
backwards-bifurcating branch reverses direction and becomes
stable near Re = 200. Then, the spanwise reflection symmetry is
broken, leading to two asymmetric branches which are themselves
destabilized at Re = 420. Above this Reynolds number, time
evolution leads first to a metastable state whose spanwise
wavelength is halved and then to complicated time-dependent
behavior. These features are in agreement with experiments.},

A fundamental class of solutions of symmetric Hamiltonian systems is
relative equilibria. In this paper the nonlinear problem near a
degenerate relative equilibrium is considered. The degeneracy creates a
saddle-center and attendant homoclinic bifurcation in the reduced system
transverse to the group orbit. The surprising result is that the
curvature of the pullback of the momentum map to the Lie algebra
determines the normal form for the homoclinic bifurcation. There is also
an induced directional geometric phase in the homoclinic bifurcation. The
backbone of the analysis is the use of singularity theory for smooth
mappings between manifolds applied to the pullback of the momentum map.
The theory is constructive and generalities are given for symmetric
Hamiltonian systems on a vector space of dimension (2n+2) with an
n-dimensional abelian symmetry group. Examples for n=1,2,3 are presented
to illustrate application of the theory."

  abstract =     "The complex interactions between spatial and temporal
                 components of the dynamics, known as spatiotemporal
                 chaos, only recently begun to be studied using ideas
                 from fundamental dynamical systems theory (Temam, 1988;
                 Goren et al. 1995; Christiansen et al. 1997). The
                 present dissertation is primarily interested in
                 studying the appearance of global bifurcations in two
                 specific physical examples, a laser with an injected
                 signal, and a catalytic reaction on a platinum surface.
                 Characteristic of these bifurcations is the presence of
                 a highly degenerate .... One of the main motivations to
                 study these equations is that some of them display
                 spatiotemporal chaos, which in many ways, resembles
                 turbulence in fluid dynamics. Recently, different
                 efforts to uncover the dynamical origin for these
                 complex states have been developing (Goren et al. 1995;
                 Christiansen et al. 1997).",

Abstract = {{This work comprises a general study of symmetry breaking for compact
   Lie groups in the context of equivariant bifurcation theory. We start
   by extending the theory developed by Field and Richardson {[}37] for
   absolutely irreducible representations of finite groups to general
   irreducible representations of compact Lie groups. In particular, we
   allow for branches of relative equilibria and phenomena such as the
   Hopf bifurcation. We also present a general theory of determinacy for
   irreducible Lie group actions along the lines previously described in
   Field {[}29]. In the main result of this work, we show that branching
   patterns for generic equivariant bifurcation problems defined on
   irreducible representations persist under perturbations by sufficiently
   high order non-equivariant terms. We give applications of this result
   to normal form computations yielding, for example, equivariant Hopf
   bifurcations and show how normal form computations of branching and
   stabilities are valid when we take account of the non-normalized tail.}},

  Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. Prior to the onset of STC, a
  spatiotemporally chaotic saddle coexists with a spatially regular
  attractor. After the transition to STC, the chaotic saddle merges with
  the attractor, generating intermittent bursts of STC that dominate the

The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) lattice with periodic boundary
conditions and n particles admits a large group of discrete
symmetries. The fixed point sets of these symmetries naturally
form invariant symplectic manifolds that are investigated in
this short note. For each k dividing n we find k degree of
freedom invariant manifolds. They represent short wavelength
solutions composed of k Fourier modes and can be interpreted as
embedded lattices with periodic boundary conditions and only k
particles. Inside these invariant manifolds other invariant
structures and exact solutions are found which represent for
instance periodic and quasi-periodic solutions and standing and
travelling waves. Similar invariant manifolds exist also in the
Klein-Gordon (KG) lattice and in the thermodynamic and
continuum limits.

    finite-time Lyapunov exponents of two and three-dimensional systems
    of ordinary differential equations. In a chaotic system, finite-time
    Lyapunov exponents describe the average rate of separation, along
    characteristic directions, of neighboring trajectories. The solution
    of the equations is a coordinate transformation that takes initial
    conditions (the Lagrangian coordinates) to the state of the system at
    a later time (the Eulerian coordinates). This coordinate
    transformation naturally defines a metric tensor, from which the
    Lyapunov exponents and characteristic directions are obtained. By
    requiring that the Riemann curvature tensor vanish for the metric
    tensor (a basic result of differential geometry in a flat space),
    differential constraints relating the finite-time Lyapunov exponents
    to the characteristic directions are derived. These constraints are
    realized with exponential accuracy in time. A consequence of the
    relations is that the finite-time Lyapunov exponents are locally
    small in regions where the curvature of the stable manifold is large,
    which has implications for the efficiency of chaotic mixing in the
    advection-diffusion equation. The constraints also modify previous
    estimates of the asymptotic growth rates of quantities in the dynamo
    problem, such as the magnitude of the induced current.",

In a smooth flow, the leading-order response of trajectories to
infinitesimal perturbations in their initial conditions is described by
the finite-time Lyapunov exponents and associated characteristic
directions of stretching. We give a description of the second-order
response to perturbations in terms of Lagrangian derivatives of the
exponents and characteristic directions. These derivatives are related to
generalised Lyapunov exponents, which describe deformations of phase
space elements beyond ellipsoidal. When the flow is chaotic, care must be
taken in evaluating the derivatives because of the exponential
discrepancy in scale along the different characteristic directions. Two
matrix decomposition methods are used to isolate the directions of
stretching, the first appropriate in finding the asymptotic behaviour of
the derivatives analytically, the second better suited to numerical
evaluation. The derivatives are shown to satisfy differential constraints
that are realised with exponential accuracy in time. With a suitable
reinterpretation, the results of the paper are shown to apply to the
Eulerian framework as well."

The approach passes through the identification of locally
stable and unstable manifolds (the Lyapunov vectors), thereby
revealing an analogy with generalized synchronization. The
method is then applied to a periodically forced chaotic
oscillator to show that the modulus of the Lyapunov exponent
associated to the phase dynamics increases quadratically with
the coupling strength and it is therefore different from zero
already below the onset of phase-synchronization. The
analytical calculations are carried out for a model, the
generalized special flow, that we construct as a simplified
version of the periodically forced Rossler oscillator.},

Floquet eigenvectors in the particular case of a periodic
orbit. These vectors, called Lyapunov vectors, can be
considered the generalization to aperiodic orbits of the
normal modes of the instability problem and are not
necessarily mutually orthogonal. The relation between
singular vectors and Lyapunov vectors is clarified. The
mechanism responsible for super-Lyapunov growth is shown to
be related to the nonorthogonality of Lyapunov vectors. The
leading Lyapunov vectors, as defined here, as well as the
asymptotic final singular vectors, are tangent to the
attractor, while the leading initial singular vectors, in
general, point away from it. Perturbations that are on the
attractor can be found in the subspace of the leading
Lyapunov vectors.},

  abstract = {
  A key a priori information used in 4DVar is the knowledge of the
system's evolution equations. We propose a method for taking full
advantage of the knowledge of the system's dynamical instabilities in
order to improve the quality of the analysis. We present an
algorithm, four-dimensional variational assimilation in the unstable
subspace (4DVar-AUS), that consists in confining in this subspace the
increment of the control variable. The existence of an optimal
subspace dimension for this confinement is hypothesized. Theoretical
arguments in favor of the present approach are supported by numerical
experiments in a simple perfect non-linear model scenario. It is
found that the RMS analysis error is a function of the dimension N of
the subspace where the analysis is confined and is minimum for N
approximately equal to the dimension of the unstable and neutral
manifold. For all assimilation windows, from 1 to 5 days, 4DVar-AUS
performs better than standard 4DVar. In the presence of observational
noise, the 4DVar solution, while being closer to the observations, if
farther away from the truth. The implementation of 4DVar-AUS does not
require the adjoint integration.

    vary. In particular, we show how the invariances
    (phase-shift, scaling law, and x, y, z translations and
    rotations) can be dealt with. Our numerical results show,
    among other things, that there exists a continuous path

Temporal integration of equations possessing continuous
symmetries (e.g. systems with translational invariance
associated with traveling solutions and scale invariance
associated with self-similar solutions) in a "co-evolving"
frame (i.e. a frame which is co-traveling, co-collapsing or
co-exploding with the evolving solution) leads to improved
accuracy because of the smaller time derivative in the new
spatial frame. The slower time behavior permits the use of
projective and coarse projective integration with longer
projective steps in the computation of the time evolution of
partial differential equations and multiscale systems,
respectively. These methods are also demonstrated to be
effective for systems which only approximately or
asymptotically possess continuous symmetries. The ideas of
projective integration in a co-evolving frame are illustrated
on the one-dimensional, translationally invariant Nagumo
partial differential equation {(PDE).} A corresponding kinetic
Monte Carlo model, motivated from the Nagumo kinetics, is used
to illustrate the coarse-grained method. A simple,
one-dimensional diffusion problem is used to illustrate the
scale invariant case. The efficiency of projective integration
in the co-evolving frame for both the macroscopic diffusion
{PDE} and for a random-walker particle based model is again
demonstrated.},

for 4 different values of its bifurcation parameter a. We
distinguish two modes of using the {K-L} decomposition: As an
analytic and synthetic tool respectively. Using the analytic
mode we find unstable fixed points and stable and unstable
manifolds in a parameter regime with structurally stable
homoclinic orbits (a=17.75). Choosing the data for a {K-L}
analysis carefully by restricting them to certain burst events,
we can analyze a more complicated intermittent regime at a=68.
We establish that the spatially localized oscillations around a
so called `strange' fixed point which are considered as
fore-runners of spatially concentrated zones of turbulence are
in fact created by a very specific limit cycle (a=83.75) which,
for a=87, bifurcates into a modulated traveling wave. Using the
{K-L} decomposition synthetically by determining an optimal
Galerkin system, we present evidence that the {K-L}
decomposition systematically destroys dissipation and leads to
blow up solutions.},

interpretation of the method closely parallels techniques used

symmetry reduction in geometric mechanics, and involves
separating the dynamics on the shape space (which determines
the overall shape of the solution) from those on the group
space (which determines the size and scale of the solution).
The method is computationally tractable as well, allowing one
to compute self-similar solutions by evolving a dynamical
system to a steady state, in a scaled reference frame where
the self-similarity has been factored out. More generally,
bifurcation techniques can be used to find self-similar
solutions, and determine their behaviour as parameters in the
equations are varied. The method is given for an arbitrary
Lie group, providing equations for the dynamics on the
reduced space, for reconstructing the full dynamics and for
determining the resulting scaling laws for self-similar
solutions. We illustrate the technique with a numerical
example, computing self-similar solutions of the Burgers
equation},

We derive feedback laws for the reduced system that minimize a

here the actuation need not be equivariant, but the actuators
can be translated in the symmetry direction. The controller
resulting from this approach leaves the dynamics associated
with the symmetry variable unchanged. Both approaches are
simple to implement, as they use standard tools available from
linear control theory. We illustrate the approaches on three
examples: a rotationally invariant planar {ODE,} an inverted
pendulum on a cart, and the {Kuramoto-Sivashinsky} equation
