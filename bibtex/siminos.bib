	peak values of the intensity changes from a sharply cusped map in

	detuned into the period doubling regime. This transformation appears
	to be related to the disappearance (with detuning) of the heteroclinic
	structural basis for the stable manifold which exists in resonance.
	This is in contrast to the evidence reported by Tang and Weiss (Phys.
	Rev. A 49 (1994) 1296) of a cusped map for both the period doubling
	chaos found with detuning and the spiral chaos found in resonance
	for seemingly Lorenz-like behavior of the far-infrared ammonia laser
	from which it was concluded that there existed a ?unique chaotic
	attractor for a single-mode laser?. }

	different approaches of control design. The first approach assumes
	that the closed loop system is affine in the control and that the
	actuation is equivariant. We derive feedback laws for the reduced
	system that minimize a quadratic cost function. The second approach
	is more general; here the actuation need not be equivariant, but
	the actuators can be translated in the symmetry direction. The controller
	resulting from this approach leaves the dynamics associated with
	the symmetry variable unchanged. Both approaches are simple to implement,
	as they use standard tools available from linear control theory.
	We illustrate the approaches on three examples: a rotationally invariant
	planar {ODE,} an inverted pendulum on a cart, and the {Kuramoto-Sivashinsky}
	equation with periodic boundary conditions.}

  abstract = {A rigorous proof is given in the standard map for the existence of
	chaotic trajectories with unbounded momenta for large enough coupling
	constant k. The obtained chaotic trajectories correspond to stationary
	configurations of the Frenkel-Kontorowa model with a finite (non-zero)
	photon gap (called gap parameter in dimensionless units). This property
	implies that the trajectory (or the configuration {ui}) can be uniquely
	continued as a uniformly continuous function of the model parameter
	k in some neighborhood of the initial configuration. A non-zero gap
	parameter implies that the Lyapunov coefficient is strictly positive
	(when it is defined). In addition, the existence of dilating and
	contracting manifolds is proven for these chaotic trajectories. ``Exotic''�
	trajectories such as ballistic trajectories are also proven to exist
	as a consequence of these theorems. The concept of anti-integrability
	emerges from these theorems. In the anti-integrable limit which can
	be only defined for a discrete time dynamical system, the coordinates
	of the trajectory at time i do not depend on the coordinates at time
	i - 1. Thus, at this singular limit, the existence of chaotic trajectories
	is trivial and the dynamical system reduces to a Bernoulli shift.
	It appears that the chaotic trajectories of dynamical systems originate
	by continuity from those which exists at the anti-integrable limits.},

	is relative equilibria. In this paper the nonlinear problem near
	a degenerate relative equilibrium is considered. The degeneracy creates
	a saddle-center and attendant homoclinic bifurcation in the reduced
	system transverse to the group orbit. The surprising result is that
	the curvature of the pullback of the momentum map to the Lie algebra
	determines the normal form for the homoclinic bifurcation. There
	is also an induced directional geometric phase in the homoclinic
	bifurcation. The backbone of the analysis is the use of singularity
	theory for smooth mappings between manifolds applied to the pullback
	of the momentum map. The theory is constructive and generalities
	are given for symmetric Hamiltonian systems on a vector space of
	dimension (2n+2) with an n-dimensional abelian symmetry group. Examples
	for n=1,2,3 are presented to illustrate application of the theory.}

	Berezin/fermion integrals. The paper focuses on a representation
	of the determinant of a square matrix in terms of a finite series,
	where each term corresponds to a loop on the graph. The representation
	is based on a fermion version of the loop calculus, previously introduced
	by the authors for graphical models with finite alphabets. Our construction
	contains two levels. First, we represent the determinant in terms
	of an integral over anti-commuting Grassmann variables, with some
	reparametrization/gauge freedom hidden in the formulation. Second,
	we show that a special choice of the gauge, called the BP (Bethe-Peierls
	or belief propagation) gauge, yields the desired loop representation.
	The set of gauge fixing BP conditions is equivalent to the Gaussian
	BP equations, discussed in the past as efficient (linear scaling)
	heuristics for estimating the covariance of a sparse positive matrix.},

	We reanalyze the ones that were previously described via a {4D} reduction
	to the center-unstable manifold {(Ambruster} et al., 1988, 1989).
	We also find a parameter region for which a manifold of structurally
	stable heteroclinic cycles exist. The existence of such a manifold
	is responsible for an intermittent behavior which has some features
	of unpredictability.},

	Lie groups in the context of equivariant bifurcation theory. We start
	by extending the theory developed by Field and Richardson {[}37]
	for absolutely irreducible representations of finite groups to general
	irreducible representations of compact Lie groups. In particular,
	we allow for branches of relative equilibria and phenomena such as
	the Hopf bifurcation. We also present a general theory of determinacy
	for irreducible Lie group actions along the lines previously described
	in Field {[}29]. In the main result of this work, we show that branching
	patterns for generic equivariant bifurcation problems defined on
	irreducible representations persist under perturbations by sufficiently
	high order non-equivariant terms. We give applications of this result
	to normal form computations yielding, for example, equivariant Hopf
	bifurcations and show how normal form computations of branching and
	stabilities are valid when we take account of the non-normalized
	tail.}}

	the homogenization of dye in two variants of an eggbeater stirring
	protocol that differ in the extent of their mixing region. In the
	first case, the mixing region is separated from the side walls of
	the channel, while in the second it extends to the walls. For the
	first case, we observe the onset of a permanent concentration pattern
	that repeats over time with decaying intensity. A quantitative analysis
	of the concentration field of dye confirms the convergence to a self-similar
	pattern, akin to the strange eigenmodes previously observed in closed
	flows. We model this phenomenon using an idealized map, where an
	analysis of the mixing dynamics explains the convergence to an eigenmode.
	In contrast, for the second case the presence of no-slip walls and
	separation points on the frontier of the mixing region leads to non-self-similar
	mixing dynamics.}

	methods to construct the pruning front. When the map is hyperbolic,
	the language of symbol sequences is regular in the sense of the Chomsky
	hierarchy and the corresponding grammatical complexity takes finite
	values. It is found that the complexity exhibits a self-similar structure
	as a function of the system parameter, and the similarity of the
	pruning fronts is discussed as an origin of such self-similarity.
	For non-hyperbolic cases, it is observed that the complexity monotonically
	increases as we increase the resolution of the pruning front.}

  abstract = {A general study of the effects of noise interacting with the deterministic
	dynamics of nonhyperbolic chaotic 2-D maps and 3-flows is presented.
	Noise in these systems can have dramatic effects on the invariant
	measure of the system. In regions of homoclinic tangencies perturbations
	are transported away from the neighborhood of the attractor, leading
	to deformations which can be one to two orders of magnitude larger
	than the noise level. A qualitative understanding is attained by
	a study of the universal properties of the unstable and stable foliation
	of the phase space in the vicinity of homoclinic tangencies. Through
	the investigation of nontrivial structures of the tangent space at
	homoclinic tangencies related to the non-normal Jacobians we obtain
	a quantitative description of these noise-induced deformations of
	the attractor. Local expansion rates which are much larger than the
	maximal Lyapunov exponent can be used as a measure of the system's
	structural instability under perturbations. We exemplify our general
	results on the {H\'enon}, Ikeda and Duffing system. A new and effective
	algorithm to calculate the homoclinic tangencies in the entire phase
	space based on the results of this paper is presented.},

	The slower time behavior permits the use of projective and coarse

	of the time evolution of partial differential equations and multiscale
	systems, respectively. These methods are also demonstrated to be
	effective for systems which only approximately or asymptotically

	invariant Nagumo partial differential equation {(PDE).} A corresponding
	kinetic Monte Carlo model, motivated from the Nagumo kinetics, is
	used to illustrate the coarse-grained method. A simple, one-dimensional
	diffusion problem is used to illustrate the scale invariant case.
	The efficiency of projective integration in the co-evolving frame

	a so called `strange' fixed point which are considered as fore-runners
	of spatially concentrated zones of turbulence are in fact created
	by a very specific limit cycle (a=83.75) which, for a=87, bifurcates

  abstract = {We present a derivation, a physical explanation and applications of
	cycle expansions in different dynamical systems, ranging from simple
	one-dimensional maps to turbulence in fluids. Cycle expansion is
	a newly devised powerful tool for computing averages of physical
	observables in nonlinear chaotic systems which combines many innovative
	ideas developed in dynamical systems, such as hyperbolicity, invariant
	manifolds, symbolic dynamics, measure theory and thermodynamic formalism.
	The concept of cycle expansion has a deep root in theoretical physics,
	bearing a close analogy to cumulant expansion in statistical physics
	and effective action functional in quantum field theory, the essence
	of which is to represent a physical system in a hierarchical way
	by utilizing certain multiplicative structures such that the dominant
	parts of physical observables are captured by compact, maneuverable
	objects while minor detailed variations are described by objects
	with a larger space and time scale. The technique has been successfully
	applied to many low-dimensional dynamical systems and much effort
	has recently been made to extend its use to spatially extended systems.
	For one-dimensional systems such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,
	the method turns out to be very effective while for more complex
	real-world systems including the Navier-Stokes equation, the method
	is only starting to yield its first fruits and much more work is
	needed to enable practical computations. However, the experience
	and knowledge accumulated so far is already very useful to a large
	set of research problems. Several such applications are briefly described
	in what follows. As more research effort is devoted to the study
	of complex dynamics of nonlinear systems, cycle expansion will undergo
	a fast development and find wide applications.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to develop analytical methods for studyingparticle
	paths in a class of three-dimensional incompressible fluid flows.
	In this paper we study three-dimensionalvolume preserving vector
	fields that are invariant under the action of a one-parameter symmetry
	group whose infinitesimal generator is autonomous and volume-preserving.
	We show that there exists a coordinate system in which the vector
	field assumes a simple form. In particular, the evolution of two
	of the coordinates is governed by a time-dependent, one-degree-of-freedom
	Hamiltonian system with the evolution of the remaining coordinate
	being governed by a first-order differential equation that depends
	only on the other two coordinates and time. The new coordinates depend
	only on the symmetry group of the vector field. Therefore they arefield-independent.
	The coordinate transformation is constructive. If the vector field
	is time-independent, then it possesses an integral of motion. Moreover,
	we show that the system can be further reduced toaction-angle-angle
	coordinates. These are analogous to the familiar action-angle variables
	from Hamiltonian mechanics and are quite useful for perturbative
	studies of the class of systems we consider. In fact, we show how
	our coordinate transformation puts us in a position to apply recent
	extensions of the {Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser} {(KAM)} theorem for three-dimensional,
	volume-preserving maps as well as three-dimensional versions of Melnikov's
	method. We discuss the integrability of the class of flows considered,
	and draw an analogy with Clebsch variables in fluid mechanics.}

	Hair cells are cells in the inner ear responsible for translating

	mechanisms have been postulated to contribute to the amplification

	Through a weakly nonlinear analysis that assumes weak periodic forcing,
	weak damping, and weak coupling, the physiologically based models
	of the two mechanisms are reduced to a system of two coupled amplitude
	equations describing the resonant response. The predictions that
	follow from an analysis of the reduced equations, as well as performance
	benefits due to the coupling of the two mechanisms, are discussed
	and compared with published experimental auditory nerve data.},

	thereby revealing an analogy with generalized synchronization. The
	method is then applied to a periodically forced chaotic oscillator
	to show that the modulus of the Lyapunov exponent associated to the
	phase dynamics increases quadratically with the coupling strength
	and it is therefore different from zero already below the onset of
	phase-synchronization. The analytical calculations are carried out
	for a model, the generalized special flow, that we construct as a
	simplified version of the periodically forced Rossler oscillator.}

	responsible for an interior crisis, a chaotic transition that results
	in the enlargement of a chaotic attractor. The numerical techniques
	explained here are important to improve the understanding of the
	connection between low-dimensional chaotic systems and spatiotemporal
	systems which exhibit temporal chaos and spatial coherence.}

	it has been shown that nonattracting chaotic sets (chaotic saddles)
	are responsible for intermittency in the regularized long-wave equation
	that undergoes a transition to spatiotemporal chaos (STC) via quasiperiodicity
	and temporal chaos. In the present paper, it is demonstrated that
	a similar mechanism is present in the damped Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
	equation. Prior to the onset of STC, a spatiotemporally chaotic saddle
	coexists with a spatially regular attractor. After the transition
	to STC, the chaotic saddle merges with the attractor, generating
	intermittent bursts of STC that dominate the post-transition dynamics.}

	velocity gradient. Consequently, we propose a Lagrangian-generalized
	capillary number CL number based on finite-time Lyapunov exponents.
	We present preliminary tests of this formalism for the stretching
	of a single drop of oil in an oscillating vortex flow, which has
	been shown previously to exhibit Lagrangian chaos. Probability distribution
	functions (PDFs) of the stretching of this drop have features that

	We give a description of the second-order response to perturbations

	exponents, which describe deformations of phase space elements beyond
	ellipsoidal. When the flow is chaotic, care must be taken in evaluating

	the different characteristic directions. Two matrix decomposition
	methods are used to isolate the directions of stretching, the first
	appropriate in finding the asymptotic behaviour of the derivatives
	analytically, the second better suited to numerical evaluation. The
	derivatives are shown to satisfy differential constraints that are

	the average rate of separation, along characteristic directions,
	of neighboring trajectories. The solution of the equations is a coordinate
	transformation that takes initial conditions (the Lagrangian coordinates)
	to the state of the system at a later time (the Eulerian coordinates).
	This coordinate transformation naturally defines a metric tensor,
	from which the Lyapunov exponents and characteristic directions are
	obtained. By requiring that the Riemann curvature tensor vanish for
	the metric tensor (a basic result of differential geometry in a flat
	space), differential constraints relating the finite-time Lyapunov
	exponents to the characteristic directions are derived. These constraints
	are realized with exponential accuracy in time. A consequence of
	the relations is that the finite-time Lyapunov exponents are locally
	small in regions where the curvature of the stable manifold is large,
	which has implications for the efficiency of chaotic mixing in the
	advection-diffusion equation. The constraints also modify previous
	estimates of the asymptotic growth rates of quantities in the dynamo

	a simple perfect non-linear model scenario. It is found that the

	where the analysis is confined and is minimum for N approximately
	equal to the dimension of the unstable and neutral manifold. For
	all assimilation windows, from 1 to 5 days, 4DVar-AUS performs better

  note = {{\tt citeseer.ist.psu.edu/zimmermann97global.html}},
  abstract = {The complex interactions between spatial and temporal components of
	the dynamics, known as spatiotemporal chaos, only recently begun
	to be studied using ideas from fundamental dynamical systems theory
	(Temam, 1988; Goren et al. 1995; Christiansen et al. 1997). The present
	dissertation is primarily interested in studying the appearance of
	global bifurcations in two specific physical examples, a laser with
	an injected signal, and a catalytic reaction on a platinum surface.
	Characteristic of these bifurcations is the presence of a highly
	degenerate .... One of the main motivations to study these equations
	is that some of them display spatiotemporal chaos, which in many
	ways, resembles turbulence in fluid dynamics. Recently, different
	efforts to uncover the dynamical origin for these complex states
	have been developing (Goren et al. 1995; Christiansen et al. 1997).}
