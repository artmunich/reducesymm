	abstract = {The {Oberbeck-Boussinesq} equations are reduced
to a two-dimensional form governing convection
between two free surfaces maintained at a constant temperature
difference. These equations are then transformed to a set of
ordinary differential equations governing the time variations
of the {double-Fourier} coefficients for the motion and
temperature fields. Non-linear transfer processes are retained
and appear as quadratic interactions between the Fourier
coefficients. Energy and heat transfer relations appropriate to
this Fourier resolution, and a numerical method for solution
from arbitrary initial conditions are given. As examples of the
method, numerical solutions for a highly truncated Fourier
representation are presented. These solutions, which are for a
fixed Prandtl number and variable Rayleigh numbers, show the
transient growth of convection from small perturbations, and in
all cases studied approach steady states. The steady states
obtained agree favorably with steady-state solutions obtained
by previous investigators.},

  stability parameter and augmenting the dynamical system with
  an orthonormal k-dimensional frame and a Lyapunov vector such
  that the frame is continuously Gram - Schmidt orthonormalized

  involved. We prove that the method is strongly stable when
  where is the kth Lyapunov exponent in descending order and we
  show through examples how the method is implemented. }

                 most fundamental and longest-standing problems in fluid
                 dynamics. Stability theory suggests that the flow
                 remains laminar for all flow rates, but in practice
                 pipe flow becomes turbulent even at moderate speeds.
                 This transition drastically affects the transport
                 efficiency of mass, momentum, and heat. On the basis of
                 the recent discovery of unstable traveling waves in
                 computational studies of the Navier-Stokes equations
                 and ideas from dynamical systems theory, a model for
                 the transition process has been suggested. We report
                 experimental observation of these traveling waves in
                 pipe flow, confirming the proposed transition scenario
                 and suggesting that the dynamics associated with these
                 unstable states may indeed capture the nature of fluid
                 turbulence.",

After reviewing Noether's theorem and its limitations, we present the Direct Construction Method to show how to find directly the conservation laws for any given system of differential equations. This method yields the multipliers for conservation laws as well as an integral formula for corresponding conserved densities. The action of a symmetry (discrete or continuous) on a conservation law yields conservation laws. Conservation laws yield non-locally related systems that, in turn, can yield nonlocal symmetries and in addition be useful for the application of other mathematical methods.
From symmetries or multipliers for conservation laws, one can determine whether or not a given system of differential equations can be linearized by an invertible transformation.},

                 components of the dynamics, known as spatiotemporal
                 chaos, only recently begun to be studied using ideas
                 from fundamental dynamical systems theory (Temam, 1988;
                 Goren et al. 1995; Christiansen et al. 1997). The
                 present dissertation is primarily interested in
                 studying the appearance of global bifurcations in two
                 specific physical examples, a laser with an injected
                 signal, and a catalytic reaction on a platinum surface.
                 Characteristic of these bifurcations is the presence of
                 a highly degenerate .... One of the main motivations to
                 study these equations is that some of them display
                 spatiotemporal chaos, which in many ways, resembles
                 turbulence in fluid dynamics. Recently, different
                 efforts to uncover the dynamical origin for these
                 complex states have been developing (Goren et al. 1995;

The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) lattice with periodic boundary
conditions and n particles admits a large group of discrete
symmetries. The fixed point sets of these symmetries naturally
form invariant symplectic manifolds that are investigated in
this short note. For each k dividing n we find k degree of
freedom invariant manifolds. They represent short wavelength
solutions composed of k Fourier modes and can be interpreted as
embedded lattices with periodic boundary conditions and only k
particles. Inside these invariant manifolds other invariant
structures and exact solutions are found which represent for
instance periodic and quasi-periodic solutions and standing and
travelling waves. Similar invariant manifolds exist also in the
Klein-Gordon (KG) lattice and in the thermodynamic and
continuum limits.

first part we discuss a general approach to determine
Lyapunov exponents from ensemble- rather than time-averages.
The approach passes through the identification of locally
stable and unstable manifolds (the Lyapunov vectors), thereby
revealing an analogy with generalized synchronization. The
method is then applied to a periodically forced chaotic
oscillator to show that the modulus of the Lyapunov exponent
associated to the phase dynamics increases quadratically with
the coupling strength and it is therefore different from zero
already below the onset of phase-synchronization. The
analytical calculations are carried out for a model, the
generalized special flow, that we construct as a simplified
version of the periodically forced Rossler oscillator.},

considered the generalization to aperiodic orbits of the
normal modes of the instability problem and are not
necessarily mutually orthogonal. The relation between
singular vectors and Lyapunov vectors is clarified. The
mechanism responsible for super-Lyapunov growth is shown to
be related to the nonorthogonality of Lyapunov vectors. The
leading Lyapunov vectors, as defined here, as well as the
asymptotic final singular vectors, are tangent to the
attractor, while the leading initial singular vectors, in
general, point away from it. Perturbations that are on the
attractor can be found in the subspace of the leading
Lyapunov vectors.},

  abstract = {
  A key a priori information used in 4DVar is the knowledge of the
system's evolution equations. We propose a method for taking full
advantage of the knowledge of the system's dynamical instabilities in
order to improve the quality of the analysis. We present an
algorithm, four-dimensional variational assimilation in the unstable
subspace (4DVar-AUS), that consists in confining in this subspace the
increment of the control variable. The existence of an optimal
subspace dimension for this confinement is hypothesized. Theoretical
arguments in favor of the present approach are supported by numerical
experiments in a simple perfect non-linear model scenario. It is
found that the RMS analysis error is a function of the dimension N of
the subspace where the analysis is confined and is minimum for N
approximately equal to the dimension of the unstable and neutral
manifold. For all assimilation windows, from 1 to 5 days, 4DVar-AUS
performs better than standard 4DVar. In the presence of observational
noise, the 4DVar solution, while being closer to the observations, if
farther away from the truth. The implementation of 4DVar-AUS does not
require the adjoint integration.

  Standard techniques for computing Lyapunov vectors produce
  results which are norm-dependent and lack invariance under
  the linearized flow. An efficient, norm-independent method
  for constructing the n most rapidly growing Lyapunov
  vectors from n-1 leading forward and n leading backward
  asymptotic singular vectors is proposed. The Lyapunov
  vectors so constructed are invariant under the linearized
  flow in the sense that, once computed at one time, they are
  defined, in principle, for all time through the tangent
  linear propagator. An analogous method allows the
  construction of the n most rapidly decaying Lyapunov
  vectors from n decaying forward and n-1 decaying backward
  singular vectors.}

                 through a circular straight pipe remains one of the
                 oldest problems in fluid mechanics. So far no
                 explanation has been substantiated to rationalize the
                 transition process by which the steady unidirectional
                 laminar flow state gives way to a temporally and
                 spatially disordered three-dimensional (turbulent)
                 solution as the flow rate increases. Recently, new
                 travelling wave solutions have been discovered which
                 are saddle points in phase space. These plausibly
                 represent the lowest level in a hierarchy of
                 spatio-temporal periodic flow solutions which may be
                 used to construct a cycle expansion theory of turbulent
                 pipe flows. We summarize this success against the
                 backdrop of past work and discuss its implications for
                 future research.",

    (phase-shift, scaling law, and x, y, z translations and
    rotations) can be dealt with. Our numerical results show,
    among other things, that there exists a continuous path
    of periodic solutions from the figure-8 orbit to a

         experiments with a single mode homogeneously
         broadened laser demonstrate that the form of the
         return map of successive peak values of the

         resonance to a map with a smoothly rounded maximum
         as the laser is detuned into the period doubling
         regime. This transformation appears to be related to
         the disappearance (with detuning) of the
         heteroclinic structural basis for the stable
         manifold which exists in resonance. This is in
         contrast to the evidence reported by Tang and Weiss
         (Phys. Rev. A 49 (1994) 1296) of a cusped map for
         both the period doubling chaos found with detuning
         and the spiral chaos found in resonance for
         seemingly Lorenz-like behavior of the far-infrared
         ammonia laser from which it was concluded that there
         existed a ?unique chaotic attractor for a
         single-mode laser?. },

Temporal integration of equations possessing continuous
symmetries (e.g. systems with translational invariance
associated with traveling solutions and scale invariance
associated with self-similar solutions) in a "co-evolving"
frame (i.e. a frame which is co-traveling, co-collapsing or
co-exploding with the evolving solution) leads to improved
accuracy because of the smaller time derivative in the new
spatial frame. The slower time behavior permits the use of
projective and coarse projective integration with longer
projective steps in the computation of the time evolution of
partial differential equations and multiscale systems,
respectively. These methods are also demonstrated to be
effective for systems which only approximately or
asymptotically possess continuous symmetries. The ideas of
projective integration in a co-evolving frame are illustrated
on the one-dimensional, translationally invariant Nagumo
partial differential equation {(PDE).} A corresponding kinetic
Monte Carlo model, motivated from the Nagumo kinetics, is used
to illustrate the coarse-grained method. A simple,
one-dimensional diffusion problem is used to illustrate the
scale invariant case. The efficiency of projective integration
in the co-evolving frame for both the macroscopic diffusion
{PDE} and for a random-walker particle based model is again
demonstrated.},

for 4 different values of its bifurcation parameter a. We
distinguish two modes of using the {K-L} decomposition: As an
analytic and synthetic tool respectively. Using the analytic
mode we find unstable fixed points and stable and unstable
manifolds in a parameter regime with structurally stable
homoclinic orbits (a=17.75). Choosing the data for a {K-L}
analysis carefully by restricting them to certain burst events,
we can analyze a more complicated intermittent regime at a=68.
We establish that the spatially localized oscillations around a
so called “strange” fixed point which are considered as
fore-runners of spatially concentrated zones of turbulence are
in fact created by a very specific limit cycle (a=83.75) which,
for a=87, bifurcates into a modulated traveling wave. Using the
{K-L} decomposition synthetically by determining an optimal
Galerkin system, we present evidence that the {K-L}
decomposition systematically destroys dissipation and leads to
blow up solutions.},

result of this paper is to derive a simple and easily
implementable set of reconstruction equations which close the
system of {ODEs} produced by Galerkin projection. The geometric
interpretation of the method closely parallels techniques used
in geometric phases and reconstruction techniques in geometric
mechanics. We apply the method to the {Kuramoto-Sivashinsky}

separating the dynamics on the shape space (which determines
the overall shape of the solution) from those on the group
space (which determines the size and scale of the solution).
The method is computationally tractable as well, allowing one
to compute self-similar solutions by evolving a dynamical
system to a steady state, in a scaled reference frame where
the self-similarity has been factored out. More generally,
bifurcation techniques can be used to find self-similar
solutions, and determine their behaviour as parameters in the
equations are varied. The method is given for an arbitrary
Lie group, providing equations for the dynamics on the
reduced space, for reconstructing the full dynamics and for
determining the resulting scaling laws for self-similar
solutions. We illustrate the technique with a numerical
example, computing self-similar solutions of the Burgers
equation},

We derive feedback laws for the reduced system that minimize a
quadratic cost function. The second approach is more general;
here the actuation need not be equivariant, but the actuators
can be translated in the symmetry direction. The controller
resulting from this approach leaves the dynamics associated
with the symmetry variable unchanged. Both approaches are
simple to implement, as they use standard tools available from
linear control theory. We illustrate the approaches on three
examples: a rotationally invariant planar {ODE,} an inverted
pendulum on a cart, and the {Kuramoto-Sivashinsky} equation
with periodic boundary conditions.},
