Dear Prof. Ratynskaia,

I am writing to apply for a post-doctoral position in your group (Employer Reference number: E-2011-0178). I received my PhD in Physics from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2009, working on non-linear dynamics with Prof. Cvitanovic. I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the French atomic energy commission (CEA) in the Paris region, focusing in the kinetic theory of plasmas as applied to problems in laser-plasma interaction.

I find that working in your group would be a great opportunity for me to continue my studies in plasma physics and at the same time gain expertise in dusty plasmas. Moreover, I find the close interaction of theorists and experimentalists suggested by the job announcement (and also evident in your group's papers) essential for my scientific development, while the involvement in the PK-4 experiment is a unique opportunity. As I hope my CV will illustrate, I have the necessary theoretical background in plasma statistical theory and computational competency to be involved in the proposed research.

Please find attached my CV with list of publications and a brief statement of research achievements as a PDF file. Please don't hesitate to contact me if any further information would be required. Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

Evangelos Siminos
