Interviews
==================================

MPIPKS Dresden May 29-31 (S. Skupin)
(did not get the fellowship, but I might get a postdoctoral
position)
	This went extremely well, people showed interest
	and we found some projects we could work on. The
	issue is whether there is a position available,
	so I am waiting for an answer.

could be a good opportunity for me to go beyond classical physics.

ETH Zurich 29-30 March (H. C. Ottinger, Material Science)

The idea was to work in Ottinger's group to learn non-equilibrium thermodynamics
and try to understand nonlinear collisionless damping in plasmas.
Ottinger did not want to hear a word about Vlasov (since collisions are ignored
and he is a fan of Boltzmann) and complained plasmas is not his topic and he cannot
follow me. At the end he decided that I am an applied mathematician, "was impressed by 
my sound background in numerical methods," but I don't fit to work with them the
physicists. 

I am rather depressed about this, since I do not consider myself as having 
particular computational skills compared to what an average plasma guy can do here
(programm GPUs in parallel and the like). The whole point was about suppressing 
irrelevant scales and I expected statistical physicists to be interest.

At least I got some good advice by one of the senior researchers in the group who
cared to listen and found the topic interesting.
