In the years 2003-2008 my MSc and Ph.D. studies at the School of Physics of Georgia Tech were supported by a teaching assistantship. Through these years my duties involved several essential parts of teaching and administration related to undergraduate coursework. Duties included preparation and grading of homework and examinations, preparing and teaching lab sessions, holding office hours for student's questions and some lecturing. The latter experience, which I consider the most important, was part of the so-called recitation sections, whose purpose is to help students develop strategies for solving problems related to their coursework. Teaching recitation sections for two semesters (for Classical Mechanics I and Physics I) helped me learn to organize and deliver a university level lecture in an engaging manner. 

The undergraduate courses I was involved in include Physics I & II, Physics Laboratory I & II, Classical Mechanics I & II, Electromagnetism, Special Relativity, Quantum Mechanics I. The typical workload was 12 hours per week.
