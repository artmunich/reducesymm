As a member of the "Computational Nonlinear and Relativistic Optics" group at the MPIPKS, I'm working in applying ideas from dynamical system's theory in the area of relativistic optics. Currently available intense laser pulses can accelerate every electron in a medium through which they pass to speeds close to the speed of light in a mere femtosecond. Optical properties of matter are fundamentally altered and in order to study propagation of such pulses in a medium, one has to take into account the complex interactions of a many-body system with the electromagnetic field.

The resulting nonlinear system of coupled partial differential equations (relativistic Vlasov equation coupled to Maxwell equations) is hard to solve, even in powerful parallel supercomputers and even simple questions are hard to answer. My research at the MPIPKS is centered around such a simple question: given a pulse of certain intensity, how can we determine the the critical density, i.e. the maximum density of a target which would allow propagation of an intense laser pulse? Numerical experiments suggest that an intense pulse can propagate in an otherwise opaque medium, by heating and expeling electrons out of the medium, 'drilling' its way through it. To understand when this effect occurs requires studying the phase-space topology of a simple dynamical system describing electron motion in the laser field and determing separatrices which act as transport bariers, preventing electrons to escape the potential well created by radiation pressure.
