As a member of the "Computational Nonlinear and Relativistic Optics" group at the Max Planck Inst. for the Physics of Complex Systems, I'm working in applying ideas from dynamical system's theory in the area of relativistic optics. Currently available intense laser pulses can accelerate every electron in a medium through which they pass,  to speeds close to the speed of light in a mere femtosecond, fundamentally altering the optical properties of matter. To study electromagnetic wave propagation of such a pulse in a medium, one has to solve a many-body problem, where (charged) particles interact with the laser field, while generating their own radiation fields. 

The resulting nonlinear system of coupled partial differential equations (relativistic Vlasov equation coupled to Maxwell equations) is hard to solve, even in powerful parallel supercomputers. Even simple questions, such as determining the maximum density of a target which would allow propagation of an intense laser pulse, known as the critical density, are hard to answer.  It is exactly this question which we try to answer, using a dynamical system's perspective. As the laser enters a target, radiation pressure pushes electrons so strongly that it induces a local electron density concentration, blocking light from penetrating further into the target. However, thermal effects can destroy this density pick and the pulse can "drill" its way into the target. Determining whether this happens requires looking into the phase-space of electron motion in the laser field and determing separatrices which act as transport bariers, preventing electrons to escape the potential well created by radiation pressure.
