As a member of the "Computational Nonlinear and Relativistic Optics" group at the MPIPKS, I'm working in applying ideas from dynamical system's theory in the area of relativistic optics. Laser pulses produced by contemporary laser systems ionize any material they go through, producing a plasma, while accelerating electrons to speeds close to the speed of light within a femtosecond. The optical properties of matter are fundamentally altered, to such an extend that a new field, that of relativistic optics, was born. In order to study propagation of such pulses in a medium, one has to take into account the complex interactions of a many-body system with the electromagnetic field.
The resulting nonlinear system of coupled partial differential equations (relativistic Vlasov equation coupled to Maxwell equations) is hard to solve, even in powerful parallel supercomputers and even simple questions are hard to answer. My research at the MPIPKS is centred around such a simple question: given a pulse of certain intensity, how can we determine the the critical density, i.e. the maximum density of a target which would allow propagation of an intense laser pulse? Numerical experiments suggest that an intense pulse can propagate in an, otherwise opaque, medium by heating and expelling electrons out of the medium, 'drilling' its way through it. To understand this effect we turned to the study of phase-space topology of a simple dynamical system describing electron motion in the laser field. Determining separatrices in phase space which act as transport barriers, preventing electrons to escape the potential well created by radiation pressure, allows a clear understanding of how pulse propagation is triggered.
