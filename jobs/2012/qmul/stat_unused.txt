I am a theoretical physicist focusing on applications of dynamical systems' theory in problems of physical relevance. After studies in the area of dynamical systems' approach to turbulence, my interests have shifted towards the fast developing field of extreme intensity laser-matter interaction, still keeping a dynamical systems' perspective.

The intensity of laser systems has seen a dramatic increase in the last twenty years, introducing exotic effects in laser-matter interaction. Laser pulses produced by contemporary laser systems ionize any matterial they go through, producing a plasma, while accelerating electrons to speeds close to the speed of light within a femtosecond. The optical properties of matter are fundamentally altered, to such an extend that a new field, that of relativistic optics, was born. In the forthcoming years planned facilities are expected to reach intensities high enough to trigger quantum effects in laser-matter interaction, requiring the development of non-perturbative methods in quantum electrodynamics, to account for the intense laser fields. The ultimate goal of the field is to generate intensities high enough to probe the quantum vacuum directly, changing its index of refraction and allowing a look into its properties.

At a more up to earth level, the field of relativistic orbits has already found many applications such as in compact particle accelerators, precision medical radiography, recreation of astrophysical enviroments in the laboratory, while there is intense research for energy applications (fusion) and cancer therapy. It is therefore a field which attracts funding
