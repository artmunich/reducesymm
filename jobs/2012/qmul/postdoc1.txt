As a postdoctoral fellow at the french Atomic Energy Commision (CEA) at Arpajon (Paris region),  I've used nonlinear dynamics insights gained through my PhD years to study problems in the area of extreme intensity laser-plasma interactions.

An important, old question in plasma physics, which has attracted renewed attention due to its possible applications in laser-plasma interactions, is that of linear stability of nonlinear electrostatic plasma waves.  The problem is described in terms of the Vlasov-Poisson system (collisionless Boltzmann equation coupled to a self-consistent electrictrostatic field in a plasma). Tools for the linear stability study which work very well in dissipative fluid flows (such as Galerkin projection onto a finite dimensional dynamical system) face fundamental difficulties due to the Hamiltonian structure, extreme range of scales and continuous linear spectrum in the Vlasov-Poisson system. These difficulties were resolved in our study using operator-theoretic techniques (spectral deformation), which establish a formal connection to dissipative systems and suppress non-essential scales. This led to a general and fast converging Galerkin method for the computation of stability of nonlinear waves of the Vlasov-Poisson system and the associated unstable, collective modes.

A parallel effort at CEA was the study of, so-called, relativistic solitary waves in laser-plasma interaction. Mathematically, such solitary waves can be thought of as homoclinic and heteroclinic connections of a certain Hamiltonian dynamical system. My contribution was to deduce the existence and provide a classification of new families of solutions, using general geometrical arguments involving the symmetries of the system and the dimensionality of invariant subspaces, leading to their efficient numerical determination.
