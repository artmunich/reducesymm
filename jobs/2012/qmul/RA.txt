The final year of my PhD thesis work, I was employed as a research assistant, funded by the "Glen P. Robinson Chair in Non-Linear Science" fund and by National Science Foundation, Division of Mathematical Sciences, through the project "Geometry of state space in plane Couette flow". The latter research project, directed by Prof. P. Cvitanovic, aims to improve our understanding of turbulent systems through the use of tools of low dimensional dynamical systems.

Within this framework, my research focused on the interplay between symmetry and nonlinear dynamics in spatially-extended systems with coherent structures. Taking as an example the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system, a one-dimensional partial differential equation that exhibits phase-turbulence, we seek a geometrical description as a dynamical system in a high-dimensional state space. This would, in turn, naturally lead to the quantitative prediction of statistical averages with tools (such as trace formulas) that relate the spectrum of evolution operators to the spectrum of periodic orbits. However, when the dynamics admit a continuous symmetry, the geometric picture is often obscured by the presence of equivalence classes of solutions. For instance, although we were able to compute a large number of periodic and relative periodic solutions, their organization in state space remains unclear.  To alleviate this difficulty, I worked on symmetry reduction for Lie groups acting on high-dimensional spaces, a problem for which classical Hilbert-basis approaches are not applicable. Our proposed solution is to use a geometrical approach based on Cartan's moving frames. This results to effective numerical schemes, but also to explicit invariant bases for symmetry reduction in higher-dimensional spaces. Application in the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and complex Lorenz systems allowed an elucidation of the role unstable manifolds of certain traveling wave solutions play in organizing the global geometry.
