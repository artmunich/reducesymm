1. I obtained an undergraduate degree in Physics from University of Thessaloniki (4-years programme) with average grade 8.17/10.
2. I obtained a MSc and PhD in Physics from Georgia Institute of Technology (not graded).
3. I have been employed as a Teaching Assistant for five years during my MSc and PhD studies, as detailed in the work experience section.
4. I have published 8 journal articles in international, peer review journals.
5. I work as a postdoctoral fellow at the Max-Planck Inst. for the Physics of Complex Systems, carrying out research within the Nonlinear and Relativistic Optics group and with external collaborators.
6. My publication record indicates an ability to both contribute new ideas in the area of applied dynamical systems (items [1] and [2] in my publication list) and to utilize ideas from dynamical systems' theory to tackle problems in physics (items [6]-[8] in my publication list).
7. My work typically involves computations and editing in electronic format. As a result I am very comfortable with IT systems and a user of unix-like and Windows operating system.
8. After a PhD focused in the dynamical systems approach to turbulence and the role of symmetries in spatially extended systems, I've entered the field of laser-plasma interactions, identifying opportunities for applications of dynamical systems methods.
9. I maintain collaboration with previous groups I've worked with, and the active environment of t the MPI for the Physics of Complex Systems has provided the opportunities for new collaborations. In handling the research effort accross multiple projects, prioritizing different demands has been essential.
10. 
11. Part of my responsibilities as a member of Prof. Cvitanovic group was to participate actively in writing grant applications.
12. As a person who has changed fields, presenting ideas to non-specialists has been an essential skill I acquired. This has influenced both my oral presentation style and my scientific writing. As an example, my papers are typicaly written with both the theoretical physicist and the applied mathematician in mind (see for example [2] and [7] in my publication list).
13. In the final year of my PhD studies I gave a series of three lectures for the advanced postgraduate course "Nonlinear Dynamics" in the School of Physics, on the topic of "Symmetry in Dynamical Systems", to a mixed audience of Physics and Mathematics departments MSc and PhD students. Through my studies and research I have acquired sufficient expertise to teach a range of subjects in applied mathematics (e.g. complex systems, nonlinear dynamics, computational mathematics) or introductory courses. I have voluntarily assumed teaching responsibilities, both as an undergraduate student (as lab assistant and grader) and as a PhD student (substitute lecturing). The reason I seek employment in a University rather than a research institute is that I consider teaching an essential and rewarding part of an academic's activities.
14. Since my research during the first five years of my postgraduate studies was funded by a teaching assistanship, I quickly acquired the skill of effectively splitting my time between research and teaching. During the last year of my PhD studies I've organized and managed the informal seminar of the Center for Nonlinear Science.
15. 
16. I've been involved voluntarily both in teaching (see point 13) and adminitstration of a research seminar (see point 14) and I have secured funding for most of my MSc and PhD studies through teaching assistanship.
17. Flexibility and co-operative spirit in my relations to collegues, can be illustrated by a number of publications which are the result of collaboration in topics which were not directly assigned to me (items [3]-[5], [6], [8] in my publication list).
18. 
19. I've survived so far all US-style examinations (GRE, qualifying exams, thesis defense) and several interviews for postdoctoral appointments.
20. I consider undergraduate courses especially pleasant as they allow for a creative approach to teaching. I consider postgraduate courses a joy to teach, as they are closer to the research level.
