Got prolongation of contract at MPIPKS for another 2 years. 
But, our group is closing (my boss got permanent position at CNRS) 
so I will be here alone (+one student?) from Spring 2014 on. 

Strathclyde offered position to fresh PhD clearly specialized for the subject.

Vladimir Tikhoncuck wants me to go to Bordeaux (http://www.celia.u-bordeaux1.fr/?lang=en), 
but the topic of the postdoc position he has would bring me back to inertial confinement 
fusion which I want to avoid. Also, people say that a third postdoc does not look 
good in one's CV. So probably it looks like I will try to stay here and try to 
either get a permanent position somewhere or to get a fellowship for the next postdoc, 
so that I could at least demonstrate the abillity to secure my own funding.

The plan:

1) Apply for Marie Curie Intra-european fellowship to go to Bordeaux
    see siminos/jobs/2014/mc-ief

3) DFG grant to stay in Germany
	[] No deadline, recycle MC proposal when ready
	[] Choose host
		[] Jena 
			pros: 	existing collaborations (both theorists and experimentalists)
				wide range of topics, nice laser systems, very serious
				experimentalists
			cons: 	in the middle of nowhere and small city. Sofia will divorce me.
		[] Dresden
			pros: I stay at MPIPKS, can keep working on scattered topics in
				nonlinear dynamics
			cons: Hard to get DFG to work in MPI (politics). Disconnected from 
				laser/plasma community
		[] Heidelberg
			pros: I could move towards the quantum regime.
			cons: Good groups are at MPI (hard to get DFG).
			Look for contact at local university? Ask Antonino?
		[] Munich
			pros: Fantastic group at MPI
			cons: Hard to get DFG to work in MPI
			Try Ruhl at local university? Collaboration with Meyer-ter-Vehn?	 

2) EPSRC postdoctoral fellowship to go to the UK
	[] Rolling applications, apply in January 2014?
	[] Choose host
		[] Warwick
			pros: The only plasma group with an interest complexity 
			cons: The laser-plasma guys there have no interest in complexity
				and they don't do very interesting stuff
		[] Queen U. Belfast
			pros: 	Very good experimentalist, existing collaboration with theorist,
				broad range of topics.
			cons: 	would have to convince Sofia
				Zepf apparently left for Jena

3) ANR fellowship to go to Bordeaux
	Getting information is already non-trivial, I don't want to think what it would be like
	to handle the beaurocracy.
	[] Next deadline February 2014??

4) IdEx Bordeaux postdoctoral fellowship
	http://www.idex-univ-bordeaux.fr/News/LabEx/IdEx-Bordeaux-post-doctoral-fellowship-programme/r831.html
	[] Next deadline June 25 2013
	[] Try June 2014?
