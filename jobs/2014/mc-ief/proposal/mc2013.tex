\section{Ethical issues  (no maximum pages)}

MAIN ETHICAL ISSUES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED
\begin{itemize}
\item Informed consent
\item Human embryonic stem cells
\item Privacy and data protection
\item Use of human biological samples and data
\item Research on animals
\item Research in developing countries
\item Dual use
\end{itemize}

AREAS EXCLUDED FROM FUNDING
\begin{itemize}
\item Research activity aiming at human cloning for reproductive
  purposes.
\item Research activity intended to modify the genetic heritage of
  human beings which could make such changes heritable (Research
  related to cancer treatment of the gonads can be financed).
\item Research activities intended to create human embryos solely for
  the purpose of research or for the purpose of stem cell procurement,
  including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer.
\end{itemize}

Include the Ethical issues table below. If you indicate YES to any
issue, please identify the pages in the proposal where this ethical
issue is described. Answering 'YES' to some of these boxes does not
automatically lead to an ethical review. It enables the independent
experts to decide if an ethical review is required. If you are sure
that none of the issues apply to your proposal, simply tick the YES
box in the last row.
