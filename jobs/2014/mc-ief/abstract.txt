Laser plasma interactions provide opportunities for the study of dynamics of many-body systems
driven out of equilibrium. The purpose of this proposal is to apply well developed tools of
nonlinear dynamics to the study of laser-matter interactions, but also to develop new methods.
Most importantly, we aim at a cross-fertilization of both areas, by proposing ways in which
signatures of complex dynamics could be measured in laser-plasma interactions.

There will be two levels in our study. The first concerns the chaotic dynamics of particles in optical
lattices (standing waves) at relativistic intensities, ignoring space charge effects. The
purpose here is to illustrate the effect of chaotic dynamics to mesurable quantities such as 
energy and radiation spectra. This will necesitate the formulation of the problem as a
chaotic scattering problem.

At the second level we will mover forward from the study of chaos to the study of complexity,
by taking into account the self-consistent dynamics of a plasma interacting with an ultra-intense
laser pulse. Here we will consider as an example problem the case of a solid density target
illuminated by an ultra-intense laser pulse, since there are many applications associated with
this setting [ion acceleration, high-harmonic generation (HHG), inertial confinement fusion (ICF)].
