Kinetic Effects in Magnetic Reconnection

From Oka etal (2010):

Small spatial size of simulation compared to typical size of energy release region in solar flares. 2D model, some 3D current-driven instabilities might have been missed. Different 'guide field' magnitudes should be taken into account. Different sizes of magnetic islands might enter into play in long enough systems, but how are these to be modeled?




1. Linear Stage (eigenproblem).

2. Nonlinear stage, close to (quasi-)equilibrium (eigenproblem).

3. Nonlinear stage, away from equilibrium: PIC (length-scale informed).

Linear Stage
------------
Tearing instability and formation of magnetic islands through reconnection. Scan parameter space efficiently, different scenarios, physically relevant current
sheets or other steady states. Distribution of sizes of magnetic islands after primary instability (why not of the same size in Oka etal? Broken symmetry?). Natural wavelength
in a large system. 

Prediction for particle acceleration (kinetic energy flux directly as a moment in our formulation).

Nonlinear Stage (eqb)
---------------
Model nonlinear steady states, compute coalescence modes. anti-reconnection(inversion of electric field direction). Identify dominant coalescence mechanism -> set length scale for the phenomenon. Is binary coalescence
a universal feature?

Nonlinear Stage (PIC)
---------------------

Excitation of unstable modes (save integration time), restrict attention to wavelengths capturing the main mechanism in coallescence dynamics. 


Magnetic confinement fusion plasmas
------------------------------------

Accurated description can lead to better control (if we know the dangerous perturbations we can supress them).
