study of magnetic
reconnection in large-scale systems is proposed. In realistic
astrophysical and laboratory plasmas kinetic
effects play an important role and at the same time many spatial scales
are involved,
secondary islands form and 3D effects have to be
taken into account. Addressing these issues goes beyond the capacity
of state-of-the-art kinetic simulation codes and computer facilities.
We plan to exploit recently developed spectral methods for the
computation of the stability of steady states of the Vlasov-Maxwell
system
which offer improvement by orders of magnitude (in terms of memory
requirements) compared to direct numerical simulations. This will allow
us
to study reconnection through the instability of current sheets which
leads to the creation of magnetic islands and through a secondary
instability leading to the magnetic island coalescence.
We expect to be able to address system sizes much larger than available
by other means. In particular, we will focus on conditions relevant to
the solar
corona and we expect our studies to lead to a realistic statistical
model for
the prediction of reconnection rate and acceleration of particles
during solar flares, a major open problem in astrophysics.</span></span></p>

Magnetic reconnection, a process during which the topology of magnetic
field lines in a plasma rapidly changes, is a fundamental mechanism of
magnetic energy release in the form of kinetic energy of the plasma
constituents. As such, it is of great importance in both laboratory and
astrophysical settings, including tokamaks, the Earth's magnetosphere,
the solar corona and extragalactic jets. However, a solid theoretical
understanding of magnetic reconnection, and in particular of kinetic
theory effects, is still lacking. The goal of this project is to
develop theoretical and computational tools to advance the kinetic
description of fundamental magnetic reconnection processes, with an
emphasis on applicability of the methods to problems of current
interest.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although great progress has been made in the theoretical description of
magnetic reconnection since the inception of the concept (Giovanelly
1946), there are still fundamental open questions (see WOPA 2010,
Yamada et al. 2010). The first studies of reconnection were within
non-ideal (resistive) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), see (Yamada et al.
2010 for a recent review). Finite resistivity allows for the
rearrangement of the topology of magnetic field lines of a plasma
equilibrium which leads to an equilibrium state of lower magnetic
energy, with the excess energy carried by plasma particles in the form
of heat or kinetic energy. The rearranged magnetic field lines can be
pictorially thought of as forming "magnetic islands," i.e. regions
consisting of closed magnetic lines. Within resistive MHD, we may
understand the formation of magnetic islands as a result of the tearing
instability of a current sheet (Furth et al. 1963) and its various
generalizations (Pritchett et al. 1980, for example). However,
theoretical predictions based on MHD underestimate the rate of magnetic
reconnection and of energy release by a large factor compared to
laboratory experiments and observations from astrophysical objects
(Yamada et al. 2010). This in turn does not allow for accurate
prediction of heating and acceleration of particles through
reconnection. Despite a constant struggle for improvement of MHD
reconnection rate predictions commencing with the classical
Sweet-Parker model (Sweet 1958, Parker 1957), the observed rates still
remain much faster.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The current focus in the study of magnetic reconnection is therefore in
moving beyond fluid theories, towards the more basic level of
description that kinetic theory offers (WOPA 2010). It has become clear
in many studies that kinetic effects have to be accounted for in order
to correctly predict the rate of reconnection and the associated energy
release and particle acceleration (Onofri et al. 2006, Yamada 2010). In
particular, it has been demonstrated through dedicated reconnection
experiments (see Yamada 2010 for a review) that the Sweet-Parker
reconnection rate only applies to collisional plasmas, with much faster
reconnection rates for collisionless conditions.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the same time, realistic physical systems encompass a wide range of
spatial scales and, in combination with symmetry breaking due to
external magnetic fields, this leads to formation of secondary magnetic
islands known as <em>plasmoids</em> (Finn and Kaw 1977, Drake et al.
2006, Fermo et al. 2010, Oka et al. 2010). In such systems, magnetic
reconnection also occurs through a secondary instability, leading to
the coalescence of plasmoids. In order to obtain statistics relevant to
physical settings one is then forced to study <em>large</em> (compared
to the length of a typical reconnection site) systems and to allow for
symmetry breaking (Drake et al. 2006, Fermo et al. 2010). Moreover,
three-dimensional (3D) effects need to be addressed, as there is
indication that the traditional picture of magnetic islands has to give
way to that of 3D magnetic ropes (Priest et al. 2003, Drake et al.
2006-ii).</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It turns out that the computational study of large, collisionless, 3D
systems which is&nbsp; required in order to facilitate theoretical
progress in the kinetic theory of magnetic reconnection, is a major
challenge to present day computational capabilities (Fermo et al. 2010,
Drake et al. 2006, 2006-ii, WOPA 2010). Even with the massive power of
present day supercomputers, simulations fall sort by several orders of
magnitude in terms of the size of systems that can be addressed,
compared to laboratory and astrophysical systems, either with finite
difference Vlasov-Maxwell solvers, or with Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To overcome these difficulties, we propose to reduce the study of
reconnection in large systems to the study of linear stability of
nonlinear Vlasov-Maxwell equilibria, in analogy to the studies of
tearing modes within the MHD framework. Both the primary instability
that results to the creation of magnetic islands and plasmoids, and the
secondary instability that leads to coalescence of islands, can be
addressed within this framework. The development of efficient and
accurate spectral methods for the determination of unstable modes
within the kinetic theory of plasmas (Siminos et al. 2010, Camporeale
et al. 2006) allows one to obtain the same accuracy with orders of
magnitude fewer variables than with a finite difference Vlasov solver
or a PIC code. We describe the method (Siminos et al. 2010) developed
by the Postdoctoral Researcher (PR) and collaborators as well as the
generalizations required to study magnetic reconnection in Sections 2
and 3, respectively.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Using this method as our primary tool, our goal will be the kinetic
theory description of both the formation of chains of plasmoids and
their reconnection through coalescence. In particular, we wish to
develop ,within a general relativistic setting,a deeper qualitative and
quantitative understanding of (a) the primary instability growth rate,
(b) the distribution of sizes of magnetic islands created through the
primary instability, (c) the island coalescence rate as a result of a
secondary instability, (d) the implications for particle acceleration,
(e) the dependence of (a)-(d) on the system parameters, boundary
conditions, current sheet geometry and guide fields. We elaborate on
these points in Section 3. The study will be augmented by state of the
art PIC codes (Lefebvre 2003, Gremillet 2007) to address nonlinear
evolution questions. However, we expect that the stability study will
help reduce computational requirements on the PIC simulations by
providing information on the relevant length scales. Our ultimate goal
is to use the insight gained by these studies to develop an accurate
and general theoretical model for the statistical description of
acceleration of particles through magnetic reconnection.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although the methodology developed will be general we plan to assess
its validity and utility by direct application to physical systems. In
particular, we intent to apply it to at least one important problem,
that of magnetic reconnection in solar flares. This is an outstanding
problem in solar physics, and an area in which the group of Prof.
Vlahos at the <em>University</em><em> of Thessaloniki</em> has a strong expertise.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>2. Methodology.</strong>
The method we propose to apply for the study of linear stability of
steady states of the Vlasov-Maxwell system, i.e. of current
distributions or steady state magnetic island configurations, has been
developed by the PR and collaborators in (Siminos et. al. 2010). It is
based on an eigenproblem formulation, derived by linearizing the
governing equations around <em>any </em>equilibrium distribution function. This leads to the problem of finding eigenvalues of a linear integro-differential operator <em>A</em>. The eigenvalues of <em>A</em> determine the linear stability of the equilibrium. This equilibrium is unstable if some of the eigenvalues of <em>A</em>
have a strictly positive real part, the largest of which being the
growth rate of the instability. The eigenproblem formulation also
provides the functional form of the unstable modes, which carries
important information about the physics of the instability, allowing
for example one to distinguish tearing from kink modes.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The approach in (Siminos et al. 2010) is based on approximating the operator <em>A</em> with a finite dimensional matrix. In particular, <em>spectral methods</em>
(see e.g. Boyd 2001) have been chosen, in which global functions bases
(e.g. Fourier) are used. In many areas of physics, most notably fluid
mechanics, spectral methods have been particularly successful in
solving eigeproblems of this form, with exponentially fast convergence
of the result with the dimension of the basis, (see Boyd 2001, for
example). This hallmark of spectral methods makes them very attractive
for the study of the stability of Vlasov-Maxwell equilibria, especially
in dimensions larger than one.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, the first convincing application of spectral methods to the
problem of nonlinear steady state stability in the kinetic theory of
plasmas only appeared, to the best of our knowledge, in (Siminos et al.
2010). In earlier attempts (Grant and Feix 1967, Camporeale et al.
2006, Paskauskas and De Ninno 2009), convergence problems arise owing
to the very nature of the operator A. In particular the linear,
advection term in Vlasov equation is responsible for the transfer of
energy to very fine velocity scales, a phenomenon known as velocity
space <em>filamentation</em>. Filamentation is connected to the
presence of a continuum of neutral, singular modes in the spectrum of
A. The method used in (Siminos et al. 2010) to suppress convergence
problems due to filamentation is that of s<em>pectral deformation </em>(Crawford and Hislop 1989)<em> </em>which
selectively damps the neutral modes, while leaving eigenvalues of
interest unaffected. The central observation in (Siminos et al. 2010)
is that the damping rate can be chosen so that the continuum spectrum
is well separated from the discrete eigenvalues of interest, and that
exponential convergence with the truncation order can be recovered.
From a physical perspective we concentrate on the thermal scale, which
is the relevant scale for the description of collective plasma modes.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In practice the distribution function is projected onto a Fourier (in
space) and Hermite (in velocity) basis, introduced in (Grant and Feix
1967, see also Camporeale et al. 2006), although other choices are
possible. As shown in (Siminos et al. 2010), with the introduction of
spectral deformation, Fourier-Hermite expansions converge fast enough
to be useful for the determination of unstable modes, even for strongly
inhomogeneous equilibria. Moreover, the matrix generated is extremely
sparse, and therefore its eigenvalues can be computed very efficiently
by iterative techniques.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One of the systems studied with this method in (Siminos et al. 2010) is
an electrostatic equilibrium with a distribution function characterized
by multiple phase space "vortices." The spectral method allows for the
determination of the unstable modes of this configuration which
illuminate the physics of the problem as they predict that the
instability will lead to vortex fusion, see Fig 2. The unstable mode
with maximum growth rate corresponds to binary vortex fusion,
regardless of the number of vortexes present in the system. This
explains numerical simulations (Ghizzo et al. 1988) in which binary
vortex fusion is observed as a response to arbitrary perturbations. We
note that the number of variables required to predict the growth rate
of perturbation with the spectral method was two to three orders of
magnitude lower than with the finite difference Vlasov code.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The relevance of the stability study to the nonlinear evolution of the
system that eventually leads to magnetic island coalescence, can only
be evaluated through numerical simulations of the nonlinear
Vlasov-Maxwell system. However, the stability study offers important
information that can be used to decrease the computational load of the
PIC simulations compared to other studies. In particular by identifying
the most unstable modes we can also identify the wavelengths that get
most strongly excited and can thus place a bound on the spatial extent
of the system that needs to be studied. The PR intents to use its
active collaborations with scientists at CEA/DAM/DIF to ensure access
to the 100-teraflop supercomputer infrastructure of CCRT (ranked 61 in
Top 500 supercomputer list, see Top500 2010) and the very versatile,
3D, relativistic PIC code CALDER (Lefebvre et al. 2003, Gremillet et
al. 2007).</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;<strong>3. Research Plan.</strong> In the present section we describe our proposed research plan in more detail and set the major milestones for its realization.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Year 1: Code Development and study of the distribution of magnetic islands. </em>The
stability method in (Siminos et al. 2010) has to be generalized to the
relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system, in order to be used in the study of
magnetic reconnection. This will be the major code development task of
the proposed research. The Fourier-Hermite expansion for stability
computations in the three-dimensional (non-relativistic) Vlasov-Maxwell
system has been used, without spectral deformation, in (Camporeale et
al. 2006) to study the unstable modes of a Harris current sheet. A
relativistic version of the Hermite expansion in one space and three
velocity dimensions has been used as a computational basis for time
dependent simulations in (Le Bourdiec 2007). We therefore expect that
there will be no technical difficulties in generalizing the method,
including spectral deformation, in the fully 3D, relativistic
Vlasov-Maxwell system.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With such a method at hand we can address the formation of magnetic
islands as a linear stability problem, involving an <em>arbitrary </em>unperturbed
current configuration, either known analytically or inferred from
numerical or experimental data. This will allow us to give affirmative
answers to important questions, such as the distribution of magnetic
islands in large systems and its dependence on the unperturbed state
and external magnetic field. Moreover, as the coefficients in the
Hermite series are directly related to physical moments of the
distribution function (Camporeale et al. 2006), we have a direct means
of estimating the energy flux to particles at the onset of the
instability. As an example calculation, we will specialize to plasma
conditions relevant to the solar corona, in which multi-island chains
are thought to play an important role (Oka et al. 2010, Yamada et al.
2010).</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Year 2: Study of island coalescence. </em>The
second phenomenon we are naturally led to study is that of the
coalescence of magnetic islands in large systems. This can be modeled
as a linear stability problem of an approximate&nbsp; nonlinear
equilibrium that involves multiple islands. Based on the experience
with the hole fusion problem in Vlasov-Poisson dynamics, we expect that
the eigenmodes will elucidate the coalescence mechanism for magnetic
islands and that this will enable us to estimate the coalescence rate
and its contribution to the acceleration of electrons. We will study
physical conditions relevant to the solar corona as a continuation of
our work on the creation of magnetic islands.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To verify the relevance of the linear stability study to the actual
coalescence of magnetic islands, we will run PIC code simulations of
the nonlinear evolution of the unstable modes detected. As mentioned in
Section 2, we expect the PIC simulations to be restricted to domains
smaller than the stability computations. We nevertheless expect that we
will be able to test all physically relevant wavelengths, as identified
by the stability calculation. Another issue which we plan to address
through PIC simulations is how the results are affected by the
turbulent environment created by the synergy of multiple current sheets
in large systems (Vlahos et al. 2009).</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Year 3: Statistical models. </em>At
this point we will be able to put together all gained information on
the creation and coalescence rate of magnetic islands in a statistical
model that could predict reconnection rate and particle acceleration in
large-scale systems. A relevant work has appeared very recently (Fermo
et al. 2010) but it relies on phenomenological input from 2D PIC codes
restricted to small system sizes, compared to physical situations. We
can speculate that, upon successful realization of the previous
milestones, we will be able to provide a complete, concrete and fully
justified methodology for the statistical description of magnetic
reconnection in large systems, including 3D effects. Specifically, all
required information, such as magnetic island distribution, coalescence
rate and the associated energy flux are expected to follow through our
stability computations. In terms of physical applications, we plan to
address once again the solar corona, with an emphasis on the
implications for particle acceleration, using the computations of the
previous milestones as a basis.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>4. Expected Impact.</strong>
Our goal is to show how quantitative predictions on kinetic
instabilities can be used to correctly predict the observed
reconnection rates and the associated particle acceleration statistics
in the solar corona. If successful, we would&nbsp; have gained great
insight into an outstanding problem in astrophysics that goes back to
the first attempts to understand solar flares through reconnection in
the 1950s. More importantly, we would have provided a general
quantitative framework to describe reconnection in different physical
settings, opening the way to a wealth of applications with similar
phenomenology. In particular, reconnection is one major source of
confinement loss in magnetic confinement fusion plasmas, and although
the scale is smaller the problem is still not completely addressed by
existing means (Yamada et al. 2010) and kinetic effects and island
coalescence are known to be important (Bierwage and Yu 2007).
Understanding reconnection in the magnetosphere also requires a kinetic
theory framework encompassing many spatial scales (Drake et al. 2006).
Large scale astrophysical systems in which a synergy of multiple
current sheets creates a strongly turbulent environment also require
kinetic treatment (Vlahos et al. 2009, Onofri et al. 2006), and we
expect our work to be a first step towards understanding the interplay
between turbulence and reconnection in astrophysical environments.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size: small;">My PhD
thesis work at the Georgia Institute of Technology involved the
study, with P. Cvitanovic and R.L. Davidchack, of the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky partial differential equation as a
one-dimensional toy-model for turbulence. In dynamical systems
studies of turbulence the goal is to understand the organization of
the infinite-dimensional state space in terms of equilibria, periodic
orbits and their stable and unstable manifolds, which serve to
connect local neighborhoods. However, when traveling wave solutions
are taken into account, the geometric approach is obscured by the
presence of equivalent, up to a continuous symmetry transformation,
trajectories. The main achievement of my thesis was to show that
continuous symmetry reduction, i.e. the identification of symmetry
related trajectories, can be implemented in a (moderately)
high-dimensional state-space and that the geometric approach of
dynamical systems can then be successfully applied. My research has
been supported by the School of Physics at Georgia Tech (through
Teaching Assistanship), NSF grant DMS-0807574 and G. Robinson Fund
(through Research Assistanship) and a Gerontelis Foundation Graduate
Student Fellowship. The results of this research have been published
in Physica D and the SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems.
Application of symmetry reduction to fluid flows is an active ongoing
effort through a collaboration of Georgia Tech (P. Cvitanovic), Univ.
of Leicester (R.L. Davidchack) and Univ. of Sheffield (A. Willis). </span></span></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size: small;">My
recent work is related to the kinetic theory description of
stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), a process that involves the growth
of a laser driven, nonlinear electrostatic plasma wave. SRS is a
major source of energy loss for current inertial confinement fusion
efforts, while a theoretical understanding of the saturation of its
growth is still missing. It has been recently suggested that the
saturation of SRS growth may be attributed to the loss of linear
stability of the electrostatic wave. However, a general and robust
method to compute stability of nonlinear electrostatic waves did not
exist. The approach I have developed, in collaboration with D.
Benisti and L. Gremillet as a postdoc at CEA, described in the
present proposal is the first practical, general, fast converging
method to compute the few most unstable modes of nonlinear
Vlasov-Poisson equilibria. From a theoretical perspective this
contributed to a better understanding of the "vortex fusion"
phenomenon in electrostatic waves. From a practical point of view it
opens new possibilities for the control of systems with long range
interactions through the selective excitation of collective modes.
These results have been presented at the <em>52nd Annual Meeting of the
APS Division of Plasma Physics</em> (November 2010), and recently submitted for
publication.</span></span></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size: small;">My
nonlinear dynamics training has proved extremely useful in another
recent project, in the field of laser-matter interaction. The current
trend is to develop compact accelerators that exploit short,
high-intensity laser pulses to accelerate particles in much higher
energies than possible with conventional accelerators of comparable
size. An open question is whether longer pulses can be utilized for
the same purpose of particle acceleration. A first step to tackle the
problem is to connect it to the existence of solitary waves in a
fluid-plasma electromagnetic model which could act as a mean to
transfer energy to the particles through wave-breaking or parametric
instabilities. With G. Sanchez-Arriaga and E. Lefebvre, we reduced
the problem to that of finding homoclinic and heteroclinic
connections of a Hamiltonian system of ordinary differential
equations. Then, dynamical systems theory allowed a systematic
determination and classification of solitary wave solutions. We are
currently working on the problem of stability and practical
excitation of such solitary waves through laser-plasma interaction.
These results have been recently submitted for publication.</span></span></p>
