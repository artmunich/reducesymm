\item[2011-02-26 Predrag] Moved Lyapunov stuff to
    \refchap{s:LyapunovVec}.


\item[2011-02-22 Predrag]
So far the gap between us and Kazzanism way of thinking is as huge
as the distance from her to Kazzahstan.
Maybe start EVO group meetings?

\item[2011-02-23 Evangelos]
I would love to be able to use EVO but I've
    failed, both in the office and at home. I will arrange to meet
    physically with Kazz \etal, include you
    through EVO?

\item[2011-02-23 Predrag]
There is also a new multi-video service from Skype (paid service), not
sure whether it is comparable to EVO (EVO is real good for projection of
your presentation on other people's seminar screen).

Anyway, go talk to him - they'll have to learn quite a bit before the
collaboration would lead to something, but it would be great if we can
get together - potentially a serious step forward in (confined)
turbulence

\item[2011-03-02 Kaz] Let's start the discussion
 Monday 2011-03-07 at 13:30 (07:30 Atlanta time) at the Institut des Syst\`emes Complexes, 57-59 rue Lhomond, Paris.

\item[2011-03-02 Predrag] Kaz, please download
\HREF{http://evo.caltech.edu/evoGate/}{EVO.caltech.edu}, see whether you can
figure out how to use it - some notes are
\HREF{http://www.cns.gatech.edu/colloquia-seminars/AudioVisual.html}
{here}. Designed for scientists, it's better than skype if you want to
share presentations.
