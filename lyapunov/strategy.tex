\chapter{Strategy, to write up}

\HREF{http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Go\%20with\%20the\%20flow}
{urbandictionary.com}:

\begin{enumerate}
   \item To not push against prevailing behavior/norms/attitudes, occasionally including bowing to peer pressure.

   \item To not attempt to exert a large amount of influence on the course of events, whether a specific series of events or events in general. A person who does this is often referred to as ``laidback'' or ``easygoing''.

   \item First known to be used by the Roman Emperor Marcus Arelius 
   in his writings 'the Meditations.' Marcus wrote a lot about the flow of thoughts and happiness and he concluded that ``most things flow naturally'' and in his opinion it was better to ``Go with the Flow'' than to try and change society.
 \end{enumerate}

\section{Papers to write}

See siminos/blog for our most complete listing of
PACS classification, keywords.

\subsection{\emph{Physica D} ``The physical dimension of...''}

\begin{description}

\item[2010-05-25 Vaggelis]
Will we follow editor's suggestion and resubmit with minor modifications only?
Deadline for receipt of the {\bf final} manuscripts is July 1st 2010.
Will we go for an arXiv version?

\item[2010-06-07 Predrag]
OK, now we have resubmitted, with minor edits. I think one should always submit
any article that is worth publishing also to arXiv;
it is open to anyone, rich or poor, and it is
more likely to reach the intended audience than only a publication through
any single journal.

\end{description}

\subsection{Reduced trace formulas?}

\begin{description}
 \item[2010-06-17 Vaggelis]
Since I have all rpo's up to level 7 for CLE I think I should try
to apply ``Continuous symmetry reduced trace formulas'' so that I get an incentive
to understand the paper. After all this group theory, it should be easier now.
 \item[2010-06-18 Predrag]
Would be nice if you did - both to understand the group theory better, and
also because I am not sure I have not missed some important detail about
invariant subspaces when I wrote the paper. Would be great to recycle KS
next, if CLE works.
\end{description}


\subsection{\emph{SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst.}}

\begin{description}

\item[2010-06-07 Predrag] Next, the
``Continuous symmetry reduction of Kuramoto-Sivashinsky ...'' paper:
40,000 \rpo s and noplace to go?
Can include movies and more graphics

\end{description}
