\item[2013-01-11 Predrag] Qi Ge  <intertwistlet@gmail.com> joined the
collaboration as a research project student (GaTech credit 3 h/week).
He will enter notes on his day-to-day progress into this log.

\item[2013-01-12 Kazumasa]
Great! Please recommend Ge Qi to read, apart from books and reviews on
chaos and orbit expansion (Chaosbook and Eckmann-Ruelle review?),
Francesco et al.'s
\HREF{http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v99/i13/e130601}{PRL}, and their
\HREF{http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3961}{long follow-up paper}.

Otherwise he wouldn't understand anything on the codes (and the project).

Hugues will stay in Japan for 2 weeks in late February. I hope that you,
the student, and Evangelos will also have time to join the discussions
during this period.

\item[2013-01-12 Qi Ge]
Great, this will be a good start point.

\item[2013-01-23 Predrag] Please ask Jeffrey M. Heninger

cannot do):
