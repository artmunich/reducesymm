\chapter{Students log}
\label{c-students}

\section{Qi Ge's project}
\label{sect:introQG}
This section is an evolving draft of the introduction to Qi Ge's project.

Predrag's vision of what the project is sketched in \refchap{c-draft}. Studying
\refchap{s:LyapunovVec} is also a good idea.
Search for\\
``2012-02-06 Evangelos Talked with Hugues at MPIPKS, created a to-do list:''
\\
to see Evangelos and Hugues concrete work plan.

We hope that Qi Ge masters computation of covariant Lyapunov vectors for
the \po s and \rpo s in our \KS\ database.

\refChap{sect:LyapKS} deals specifically with the \KS\ calculations.

\section{Daily log}

This section is the daily (or at least, bi-weekly)  log of the students'
work.

\refChap{sect:LyapKS} deals specifically with the \KS\ calculations.


\begin{description}

\item[2013-01-11 Predrag] Qi Ge  <intertwistlet@gmail.com> joined the
collaboration as a research project student (GaTech credit 3 h/week).
He will enter notes on his day-to-day progress into this log.

\item[2013-01-12 Kazumasa]
Great! Please recommend Ge Qi to read, apart from books and reviews on
chaos and orbit expansion (Chaosbook and Eckmann-Ruelle review?),
Francesco et al.'s
\HREF{http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v99/i13/e130601}{PRL}\rf{ginelli-2007-99}, and their
\HREF{http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3961}{long follow-up paper}\rf{GiChLiPo12}.

Otherwise he wouldn't understand anything on the codes (and the project).

Hugues will stay in Japan for 2 weeks in late February. I hope that you,
the student, and Evangelos will also have time to join the discussions
during this period.

\item[2013-01-12 Qi Ge]
Great, this will be a good start point.

\item[2013-01-23 Predrag] Please ask Jeffrey M. Heninger
<jeffrey.heninger@gatech.edu> to help you get started with this
subversion repository (come to me or skype me if there is something you
cannot do):

\texttt{svn://zero.physics.gatech.edu/siminos}

user: geqi  password: Lyapunov

\item[2013-02-14 Qi Ge 2 Kazumasa]
Can you send me the code about computing the CVLs of the KS system?
So what algorithms you use in the time step simulation, this will
help me understand the code.

\item[2013-02-14 Predrag to Qi Ge] If you look into directory
siminos/chaos/ and pdflatex blog.tex, you can see an example of what
a student work log looks like (after a semester of so of work). Chao
Shi stopped with daily / weekly updates, and I ended up writing all
of Chapter 1 {\em Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation}, so we stopped the
project.

\item[2013-02-14 Predrag to Qi Ge] Please start writing down the
ideas we talked about today into \refsect{sect:introQG}; this will
be a continuously evolving draft of the introduction to the project
report. I have entered pointers to Evangelos, Hugues and my ideas
about what the project. If we know where are you in the project, we can
help you.
