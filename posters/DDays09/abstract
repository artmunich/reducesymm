Using SO(2)-equivariant Complex Lorenz flow as an example we present an approach to continuous symmetry reduction of ODE's
that can be efficiently carried out in high dimensional problems, specifically those arising from truncations of PDE's.
The usual approach in the low dimensional case is through projection to a basis of invariant polynomials, the determination
of which becomes computatinally prohibited very soon as the dimension of the system increases. Here we demonstrate that, for
the purpose of describing the system in terms of return maps, appropriately constructed Poincare sections can be used
efficiently. We present the approach in terms of a low dimensional truncation of Maxwell-Bloch equations that describe a ring
laser known as the Complex Lorenz system. The procedure allows the reduction of dynamics to an one-dimensional unimodal map that
facilitates the systematic determination of a large number of relative periodic orbits that organize the attractor. We also 
present preliminary results for the case of O(2)-symmetric Kuramoto-Shivasinsky partial differential equation in a periodic domain.
