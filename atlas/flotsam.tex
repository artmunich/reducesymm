\subsection{Introduction}
\label{s:introFlot}

Recent insights in the theory of higher-dimensional chaotic dynamical systems
necessitate reexamination of two of the basic tools of the theory of
dynamical systems, Poincar\'e sections and symmetry reduction.

Over the last decade, researchers have gained new insights into the
theory of higher-dimensional chaotic dynamical systems. These
developments offer a promising dynamical framework to with which to study
turbulence. In this picture, turbulence is viewed as a walk through a
forest of exact solutions of the governing equations with each solution
shaping the local \statesp\ dynamics.

Making full use of these ideas necessitates reexamination of two of the
basic tools of the theory of dynamical systems, Poincar\'e sections and
symmetry reduction.

Taking this approach, the dynamics of moderate \Reynolds\ turbulent flows
are visualized in the $\infty$-dimensional \stateDsp\  using \eqv\
solutions of the \NSe\ to construct dynamically invariant, intrinsic, and
representation independent coordinate frames \rf{GHCW07}. Visualizing of
turbulent flows in these frames inform a new way of thinking about the
role {\recurrStr s} that play in shaping turbulence: The observed
{\cohStr s} are the physical images of the flow's least unstable
invariant solutions, with chaotic dynamics arising from a sequence of
transitions between these states, and the intrinsic low-dimensionality of
turbulence resulting from the low number of unstable eigendirections of
these states. Unstable \po s are of particular importance, as they
provide the skeleton underpinning the chaotic dynamics\rf{DasBuch}: the
geometry of the \statesp\ flow near onset of turbulence is shaped by the
chaotic saddle, a set of unstable solutions and their heteroclinic
connections.

The importance of a given invariant solution is made precise by periodic
orbit theory which assigns a deterministic weight with which the solution
contributes to any dynamical average over the chaotic component of the
flow \rf{DasBuch}. Consideration of continuous symmetries extends this
theory to sums over \emph{relative} periodic orbits\rf{Cvi07},
time-dependent solutions which recur periodically in co-moving frames
translating along and/or rotating about the axes of symmetry with
different translational and rotational velocities for each solution.

The $\infty$-dimensional \stateDsp\
representation\rf{GHCW07} of PDEs, such as \reffig{f:MeanVelocityFrame},
enables us to track the unstable manifolds of invariant
solutions, the heteroclinic connections between them\rf{GHCV08}, and
{provides us with} new insights into the nonlinear \statesp\ geometry and
dynamics of moderate \Reynolds\ wall-bounded flows.

\subsection{Pipe flows}
\label{s:reviewFlot}

As long as one is focusing on a single solution of \NSe, there are many
excellent, physically insightful $3D$ visualizations of the flow:
velocity fields on flow sections, isovorticity surfaces, videos of the
flow, and so on. But today we own dozens of exact \eqv\ and \reqv\
solutions for a given turbulent flow, and we are commencing an exploration of
states of turbulent fluids in terms of the unstable \po\ solutions whose
number, as a function of the increasing period, is growing exponentially.
How are we to visualize \emph{the totality} of these solutions in one go?

The answer was given by \cite{hopf48}, who envisioned the function space
of {\NS} velocity fields as an infinite-dimensional \statesp\ $\pS$ in
which each instantaneous state of $3D$ fluid velocity field $\vec{u}(\bx)$ is
represented as a unique point $\ssp$. In our particular application we
can represent $\ssp = (\vec{u}_{nkm})$ as a vector whose elements are the
primitive discretization variables \refeq{pipeDiscr}. The $3D$ velocity
field given by $\vec{u}_{knm}(\zeit)$, obtained from integration of the
\NSe\ in time, can hence be seen as trajectory $\ssp(\zeit)$ in
$\approx 100,000$ dimensional space spanned by the free variables of our
numerical discretization, with the \NS\ equations \refeq{NavStokesDev}
rewritten as
\beq
   \dot{\ssp} = \vel(\ssp) ,
   \qquad
   \ssp(\zeit) = \ssp(0)
            + \int_0^\zeit \! \mathrm{d}\zeit' \, \vel(\ssp(\zeit'))
\,,
\ee{symbolicNS}
where the current state of the fluid $ \ssp(\zeit)$ is the time-$\zeit$
forward map of the initial fluid state  $\ssp(0)$.

In order to quantify whether two fluid states are close to or far from
each other, one needs a notion of distance between two points in
\statesp, measured here as
\beq
  \Norm{\ssp-\ssp'}^2  = \braket{\ssp-\ssp'}{\ssp-\ssp'} =
\frac{1}{V}
\int_\bCell \! d \bx \;
(\vec{u}-\vec{u}') \cdot (\vec{u}-\vec{u}')
\,.
\ee{innerproduct}
There is no compelling reason to use this {`energy norm'}, other than
that velocity fields is what is given in a numerical computation. What
norm one actually uses depends very much on the application.
Visualizations of trajectory \refeq{symbolicNS} are of necessity
projections onto two or three dimensions.

Recently, \cite{GHCW07} have shown that the dynamics of different regions
of {\statesp}, considered as a high-dimensional vector space,
can be elucidated more profitably by a computationally
straight\-forward sets of \emph{physical} coordinates. One identifies
several prominent states of the flow $\vec{u}_A$, $\vec{u}_B$, $\dots$, such as
{\eqv} states and their linearized stability eigenvectors, states in whose neighborhoods the
turbulent flow spends most of the time, and from them constructs, by
Gram-Schmidt or (anti)-symmetrizations, an orthonormal basis set
$\{\be_1, \be_2, \cdots, \be_n\}$. The evolving fluid state $\bu(\zeit)$
is then projected onto this basis using the inner product
\refeq{innerproduct},
\beq
\ssp(\zeit) =(\ssp_1, \ssp_2, \cdots, \ssp_n, \cdots)(\zeit)
    \,,\qquad
\ssp_n(\zeit) = \braket{\vec{u}(\zeit)}{\be_n}
\,.
\ee{intrSspTraj}
Low-dimensional projections of the flow can be viewed in any of the $2D$ planes
$(\ssp_m, \ssp_n)$ or in $3D$ perspective views $(\ssp_{\ell},\ssp_m,
\ssp_n)$. An example is the \reffig{f:MeanVelocityFrame} projection on
the $3$\dmn\ frame $\{{\be}_1,{\be}_2,{\be}_3\}$ defined in \refeq{FrenetFrame1}.
It is worth emphasizing that the method affords low-dimensional {\em
visualization} without any low-dimensional {\em modeling} or dimension
reduction; the dynamics are computed with fully-resolved direct numerical
simulations.

Such visualizations are a prerequisite to uncovering the
interrelations between (the infinite number of) invariant solutions, and
constructing symbolic dynamics partitions of \statesp\ needed for a
systematic exploration of turbulent dynamics, the key challenge that we
address here for the case of turbulent pipe flows.

\subsection{Symmetries of flows}
\label{s:symmFL}

In our quest for \reqva\ and \rpo s\rf{ACHKW11} we
find it advantageous to use a `compensatory' norm %\refeq{compensNorm}
that enhances the weight of cross-stream velocities.

\subsubsection{Symmetry-induced coordinate frames}
\label{s:symmIndCoo}

At least locally, presence of a continuous symmetry suggests two
natural mutually orthogonal basis vectors, the group action tangent and
curvature vectors.

Consider the one-parameter rotation group \SOn{2} acting on a smooth
periodic function $u(\gSpace + 2\pi) = u(\gSpace)$ defined on domain
$\gSpace \in [0,2\pi)$, expanded in the Fourier basis
\refeq{eq:ksexp}.
    \PC{replace this by the original, 2\dmn\  real \SOn{2}  representation}
Parametrize the forward
translation by the continuous parameter $\phi$,
\(
    \LieEl(\phi)\,u(\gSpace) = u(\gSpace-\phi)
\,,
\)
or, in the Fourier basis,
\(
   \LieEl(\phi) \,\ssp = \mathrm{diag}\{ \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}m\phi} \} \,\ssp
\,.
\)
The tangent to the group orbit at the point $\ssp$ is then given by
the first derivative with respect to the group parameter,
\bea
   {\bf t}(\ssp) &=&
   \lim_{\gSpace\to 0}
   \left(\LieEl(\gSpace)\,\ssp - \ssp\right)/\gSpace
   = \mathrm{diag}\{ -\mathrm{i}m \} \, \ssp = \Lg \ssp,
\label{eq:tang}
\eea
where $\normVec$ is a unit vector normal to the tangent. The pair of unit vectors
    \PC{2011-10-28
    ``As $\Norm{\LieEl(\gSpace)\slicep}$ is a constant, for the group tangent
    vector $\Lg_\gSpace \slicep$ evaluated at $\slicep$ \refeq{eq:tang}
    %GroupTangField} is normal to $\slicep$, and the term
    $\braket{\slicep}{\Lg_\theta\,\slicep}$ vanishes ($\Lg_{\theta}$ is
    antisymmetric).''
The state vector $\ssp$ is not normal to \normVec(\ssp), as $\braket{\ssp
\Lg^2}{\ssp} = - \Norm{\groupTan(\ssp)}^2 \neq 0$, but can one use it to
produce from $\ssp$ the 3. local eigenbasis unit vector? Have not thought
that through. If we do that here, need to rewrite text leading to
\refeq{PCsectQ0}.
    }
\beq
\{{\be_n},{\be_{n+1}}\} =
\{\groupTan(\ssp)/\Norm{\groupTan(\ssp)},\normVec(\ssp)\}
\ee{FrenetFrame}
forms a local orthogonal Frenet-Serret frame at $\ssp$, and can be useful
in constructing the \statesp\ basis vector set \refeq{intrSspTraj}.

For a time-dependent group parameter
$\gSpace$, the phase speed $\dot{\gSpace}$ along the group tangent
evaluated at the \statesp\ point $\ssp$ (the `Cartan derivative') is
given by
\beq
\LieEl^{-1}\dot{\LieEl} \,\ssp % =e^{-\gSpace \cdot \Lg} \,
     =\mathrm{e}^{-\gSpace \Lg} \,
\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} ~~}{\mathrm{d} \, \zeit} \, % e^{\gSpace \cdot \Lg}\ssp
                             \mathrm{e}^{\gSpace \Lg}\right)\ssp
    =\dot{\gSpace} \, \groupTan(\ssp)
%    =\dot{\gSpace}\cdot \groupTan(\ssp)
\,.
\ee{CartanDer}

Bunsen burner, invented by G\"ottingen chemistry prodigy Robert Bunsen in
1855, entered popular culture in  in 1963 as Johnny Cash
\etal\rf{CaCaKi63} ``\HREF{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIBTg7q9oNc}
{Ring of Fire}'' (\reffig{fig:A27RoFir}), and its flame front
instabilities were modeled in 1976 by Kuramoto\rf{ku} and
Sivashinsky\rf{siv} by one of the simplest nonlinear PDEs that exhibit
spatiotemporally chaotic behavior. The time evolution of the  flame front
velocity $u=u(x,t)$ on a periodic domain $u(x,t) = u(x+L,t)$ is given by
\beq
  u_t = F(u) = -u\,u_x-u_{xx}-u_{xxxx}
    \,.
\ee{ks}
Spatial periodicity $u(x,t)=u(x+L,t)$
makes it convenient to work in the Fourier space,
\beq
  u(x,t)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} a_k (t)\, e^{ i k x /\tildeL }
\,,
\ee{eq:ksexp}
with the $1$-dimensional PDE \refeq{ks}
replaced by an infinite set of
ODEs for the complex Fourier coefficients $a_k(t)$:
\beq
\dot{a}_k= \pVeloc_k(a)
     = ( q_k^2 - q_k^4 )\, a_k
    - i \frac{q_k}{2} \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} a_m a_{k-m}
\,,
\ee{expan}
where $q_k = 2\pi k/L$.


\subsection{Symmetries of pipe flow}
\label{s:SymmPipe}
% former siminos/atlas/symm.tex



Let $\LieEl(\phi,\shift)$ be the shift operator such that $\LieEl(\phi,0)$
denotes an azimuthal rotation by $\phi$ about the pipe axis,
and $\LieEl(0,\shift)$ denotes the stream-wise translation by
$\shift$; let $\sigma$ denote reflection about the $\theta=0$ azimuthal
angle:
\bea
\LieEl(\phi,\shift) \, [u,v,w,p](r,\theta,z)
        & = & [u,v,w,p](r,\theta-\phi,z-\shift)
			  \continue
\sigma \, [u,v,w,p](r,\theta,z) \;\; & = & [u,-v,w,p](r,-\theta,z)
\label{pipeSymms}
\eea
%
The \NSe\ for pipe flow are equivariant under these transformations. The
symmetry group of stream-wise periodic pipe flow is thus $\Group =
\On{2}_\theta \times \SOn{2}_z = \Dn{1} \ltimes \SOn{2}_{\theta} \times
\SOn{2}_z$, where $\Dn{1} = \{ e,\, \sigma \}$ denotes azimuthal
reflection, $\ltimes$ stands for a semi-direct product (in general,
reflections and rotations do not commute), and the subscripts $z,\theta$
indicate stream-wise translation and azimuthal rotation respectively.

In the literature
(see, \eg\ \cite{Recke2010}) such \SOn{2} is often referred to as the
circle group $S^1$, also denoted `one-torus' $T^1$.

\section{How to slice}
\label{s:algorithm}

Our guiding principle is to chose a \slice\ such that the distance
between a `{\template}' state {\slicep} and nearby group orbits is
\emph{minimized}, \ie, identify the point $\sspRed$ on the group orbit
\refeq{sspOrbit} of a nearby state $\ssp$ which is the closest match to
the {\template} point {\slicep}.

\refFig{fig:sliceimage}, new proposal: take points on the good,
    blue \po, run each along the group orbit until $\sspRSing \in S$
    where it intersects the \sliceBord, see \refeq{sspRSing}, and thus plot
    the border of where the local slice ends, once on the left, and once
    on the right of the {\template}. Catch - I have not thought this
    through, not sure that the condition \refeq{sspRSing} can be
    satisfied on every group orbit...

\subsection{Rotation into the \slice}

As long as the norm is discretization independent, the \slice\ condition
\refeq{PCsectQ0} is independent of the numerical representation $\ssp$ of
the flow $\vec{u}$, be it finite difference, spectral, and so on. The
slice condition is solved for $\shift$ every few time steps using
Newton's method, where a good initial guess for $\shift(\zeit)$ is
obtained from the previous value and $\dot{\shift}(\zeit)$.

To avoid this, a global
atlas has to be pieced together from local \slice\ charts, fixed by
a well-chosen set of
\template s $\slicep{}^{(j)}$.
Shifts $\shift_j(\zeit)$ are tracked for each local \slice\ chart $\pS{}^{(j)}$,
such that the next $\shift_{j+1}(\zeit)$ is selected at intersection with
$\pS{}^{(j+1)}$
to minimize $\Norm{{\ssp}-{\ssp_i}}$.

%\APW{111104 The first sentence requires simplifying!}
As group orbits % of compact Lie groups
are smooth manifolds, have natural linear
representations (under linear action of a symmetry group, \statesp\
decomposes into a sum over irreducible subspaces), and have natural local
coordinate frames (the group tangent, curvature Frenet-Serret frames
\refeq{FrenetFrame}), good \slice s should be easier to construct than
the elusive ``good'' Poincar\'e sections of the time-evolution flows.
Indeed, as a generic \slice\ \refeq{PCsectQ0} is the set of all
group-orbit points closest to a given {\template}, it slices the group
orbits of \emph{all} full \statesp\ points\rf{FrCv11}. However, for a
nonlinear flow, there is no single \slice\ that really does the job: our
\slice\ is locally a hyperplane, expected to be a good description of
solutions similar to a given {\template} in some open neighborhood. The
variational distance condition \refeq{PCsectQ0} is only an extremum
condition, and as the group orbits of highly nonlinear states are highly
contorted (see \reffig{fig:2830GO6}\,{\it b}), they can have many
extrema, and multiple sections by a \slice\ hyperplane. For example, an
\rpo\  torus is always intersected by a \slice\ hyperplane in two or more
sections, see \reffig{fig:sliceimage}.

    \ifdraft\color{blue}
        {\bf 2012-03-15 Predrag} \refFig{fig:sliceimage}, new proposal:
        take points on the good, blue \po, run each along the group orbit
        until $\sspRSing \in S$ where it intersects the \chartBord, see
        \refeq{sspRSing}, and thus plot the border of where the local
        slice ends, once on the left, and once on the right of the
        {\template}. Catch - I have not thought this through, not sure
        that the condition \refeq{sspRSing} can be satisfied on every
        group orbit...
    \color{black}\fi

It should be emphasized that we never need to integrate the reduced
equations \refeq{EqMotMFrame}; numerical simulations are always carried
out in the full \statesp. Slicing is implemented as postprocessing of
numerical or experimental data, by rotating full \statesp\ trajectories
into the \slice, as in \reffig{fig:sliceimage}.


\subsection{Dynamically important solutions and Newton's method}
\label{s:reqva}

The way in which the \mslices\ enables to find initial
guesses for $(\vec{u}(0),\period{},\shift)$, is the main differences
between this study and the previous ones.

Here we take as initial guesses samples of nearly recurrent velocity
fields generated by long-time simulations of turbulent dynamics
\rf{pchaot,CviGib10}. The intent is to find the {\em dynamically most
important} solutions, by sampling the turbulent flow's natural measure.
In practice, sufficiently good full \statesp\ initial guesses for
$(\vec{u}(0),\period{},\shift)$ would be almost impossible to find.
Checking correlations between $\vec{u}(\zeit)$ and
$\LieEl(0,\shift)\,\vec{u}(\zeit-\period{})$ for each $\period{}$, and
more problematically, for all possible shifts $(\phi,\shift)$, is an
unrealistic task. The \mslices, however, enables us determine close
recurrences  from the symmetry-reduced time series, and locates the
dynamically most important solutions, \ie, those trajectories that are
most likely to be observed in a long-time turbulent simulation. The \rpo
s are reduced to \po s, whose unstable manifolds are much easier to track
in the \reducedsp. The \rpo\ shift $\shift$ is given by the
reconstruction equation, \refeq{reconstrEq}, or, in practice, by phase
shift $\shift(\period{})-\shift(0)$ accumulated by the intermediate
Newton steps that keep the orbit within the slice.

Without symmetry reduction, the detection of the nearest recurrence of a
state near a previous state, earlier on the the same trajectory, would
require the calculating the minimum over all possible shifts. Within the
symmetry-\reducedsp\ the determination of recurrences is simple, as the
slices are constructed by requiring that the slice points are the minimum
distance points between the group orbits of the two states.
