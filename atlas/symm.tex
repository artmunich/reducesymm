%% A27*-pipeSymms.* %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

What is a symmetry? A visualization of fluid dynamics of a pipe flow,
\reffig{fig:A27-pipeSymms}, affords an intuitive illustration.
A stream-wise periodic pipe flow under azimuthal rotations and stream-wise
translation (those also become \SOn{2} rotations in a numerical stream-wise
periodic pipe).

Each \SOn{2} group orbit is topologically a circle, but it traces out a
complicated \statesp\ curve composed of many Fourier modes nonlinearly
coupled by turbulent dynamics and thus of comparable magnitudes. Together
the two \SOn{2} sweep out contorted and hard to visualize $T^2$ tori (see
\refref{ACHKW11}), but we shall illustrate here the key ideas by a much
simpler example, the $\SOn{2}$-equivariant Gibbon and
McGuinness\rf{GibMcCLE82,FowlerCLE82} \cLe\ of geophysics and laser
physics,
\bea
	\dot{x}_1 &=& -\sigma x_1 + \sigma y_1
        \,,\qquad
	\dot{x}_2 \,=\, -\sigma x_2 + \sigma y_2
        \continue
	\dot{y}_1 &=& (\RerCLor-z) x_1 - \ImrCLor x_2 -y_1-e y_2 \continue
	\dot{y}_2 &=& \ImrCLor x_1 + (\RerCLor-z) x_2 + e y_1- y_2\continue
	\dot{z} \; &=& -b z + x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2
    \,.
\label{eq:CLeR}
\eea
Here the parameters are set to Siminos values $\RerCLor=28,\,
\ImrCLor=0,\, b=8/3,\, \sigma=10,\, e= 1/10$. (For the background and an
in-depth investigation of the model  see \refrefs{SiminosThesis,SiCvi10}.)

  [\CLf: $\cycle{01}$ {\rpo} group orbit]{
  (a)
  The strange attractor of \cLf.
  (b)
  The initial \reqv\ $\REQV{}{1}$ point is shown by the red dot, and its
  group orbit / trajectory by the dashed red line. One period of the
  $\cycle{01}$ {\rpo} is shown by the solid blue line. The group orbit of
  its (arbitrary) starting point is shown by the dashed blue line: after
  one period the trajectory has returned to the group orbit but with a
  different phase. The wurst, \ie, the group orbit of the $\cycle{01}$
  trajectory (dark blue) is shown by the cyan surface. Trajectory of the
  further 15 repeats of $\cycle{01}$ (faint dotted lines) traces out this
  torus; in that time the slowly drifting \reqv\ $\REQV{}{1}$ has
  advanced to the next red dot (red line).
  }
\label{fig:CLf01group}
\end{figure}

The strange attractor of the \cLf\ is shown in
\reffig{fig:CLf01group}\,(a). It's a mess. Why? The problem of dynamics
in presence of symmetry can perhaps understood this way: dissipative
flows settle into solutions with low friction, and as drifting is
energetically cheap, rather than do work, solutions tend to drift along
non-shape-changing symmetry directions which burn no energy.
    \PC{2012-04-12 remember to throw away cLe-fullDB.png }

A continuous symmetry leads to drifting invariant solutions.
A {\em \reqv} (traveling wave, rotational wave, ...) is a trajectory
whose velocity field lies within the group tangent space,
\(
\vel(\ssp) = c \cdot \groupTan(\ssp)
\) %\label{phaseVel}
with a constant {\phaseVel} $c$, and whose time evolution is thus
confined to the group orbit; think of an unchanging body carried by a
stream. A {\em \rpo} $\pS_p$ is a trajectory which exactly recurs
\beq
\ssp(\zeit) = \LieEl_p \, \ssp(\zeit + \period{p} )
    \,,\qquad
\ssp(\zeit) \in \pS_p
\ee{RPOrelper1}
after a fixed {relative period} $\period{p}$, but shifted by a fixed
group action ${\LieEl}$ that maps the endpoint $\ssp (\period{}) $ back
into the initial point cycle point $\ssp (0) $; think of a dancer moving
across the stage through a set of motions and then striking the initial
pose, or study the pipe flow sketches \reffig{fig:A27-pipeSymms}.

As the $\SOn{2}$ transformations act on the \cLf\ only through the
simplest, $m=1$ Fourier mode, here all group orbits are circles, and appear
elliptical in most $d=5 \to 3$~dimensions projections. Nevertheless, even
the wurst traced out by the very simplest, short \rpo\ $\cycle{01}$ shown
in \reffig{fig:CLf01group}\,(b) is not so easy to get one's head around:
you are looking at a 3\dmn\ projection of a \emph{torus} embedded in 5
dimensions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Evolution in time decomposes the \statesp\ into spaghetti of 1\dmn\
trajectories $\ssp(\zeit)$, each determined by a single point $\ssp(0)$
on it. A section of codimension 1 `quotients' the continuous time
parameter $\zeit$, but for unstable trajectories one really needs a set
of short-time recurrence separated points $\{\sspRed_n\} =
\{\ssp(\zeit_n)\}$ to capture a chaotic flow.

Symmetries stratify the \statesp\ into an onion, each layer a group orbit
(\reffig{fig:BeThMovFr}). We are free to replace a given flow
$\ssp(\zeit)$ by another, physically equivalent flow
$\ssp(\zeit)=\LieEl(\zeit)\,\sspRed(\zeit)$ by any, in general time
dependent {\em moving frame} transformation $\LieEl(\zeit)$. For example,
to film our dancer we can mount the camera on a cart moving alongside
her. So, in presence of continuous symmetries, there are two kinds of
change in time: a dancer, continuously changing shapes, or a drifter, merely
shuffling along the easy, shape non-changing directions. We will presently
banish the drifters, and just enjoy the dance.
