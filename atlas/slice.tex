\section{Slices}
% Reduction of continuous symmetry
\label{s:slice}

The goal of \emph{symmetry reduction} is to replace each group orbit by a
unique point in a lower-dimensional symmetry-\reducedsp\ $\pSRed =
\pS/\Group$, as sketched in \reffig{fig:BeThTraj}.

What follows is very much like the the \refsect{s:cut}; due to the linear
action of the symmetry group, 'slicing' is easier that `sectioning', but
more unfamiliar - that is why we started with reviewing Poincar\'e
sections.

\subsection{The 3 bridges to nowhere}

Purely group-theoretical, no dynamics to inform it.

\subsubsection{Polar coordinates}

\subsubsection{Hilbert bases}

\DB{2012-04-10}{A book report on Hilbert bases by Daniel Borrero}
One approach to symmetry reduction that is often used for low-dimensional
dynamical systems is to rewrite the dynamics in terms of a Hilbert
invariant polynomial basis (see \refref{GL-Gil07b} for a clear and
detailed discussion of this method). The idea here is that one can take
the dynamics in equivariant state space coordinates
$(x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_d)$ and rewrite them in terms of polynomials of these
variables $(u_1,u_2,u_3,...,u_m)$ that are invariant under the group
action. In general, these polynomials are non-unique and $m \geq d$, so
that the flow becomes embedded in a larger m-dimensional state space.
While these polynomials are linearly independent, they are functionally
dependent by a set of relations called syzygies. The syzygies constrain
the flow to lower dimensional, but non-trivial, manifolds in the
m-dimensional space.

Sometimes the determination of a Hilbert basis can be informed by
intuition about nonlinear preserved quantities such as rotationally
invariant length $r^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_d^2$. In general,
however, there is no general strategy for creating a useful Hilbert
basis. The algebra required is quite involved and the required
computations become very large for problems with as few as ten
dimensions\rf{gatermannHab}. This makes the method of Hilbert bases
unfeasible for dealing with turbulent fluid flows.

\subsubsection{Method of connections}

\subsubsection{A co-moving frame}
Visualizing a single `relative' trajectory in its co-moving frame, moving with
the mean phase velocity of a given solution, is useful if we are
concerned with that individual solution. A co-moving frame is useless if
we are concerned with studying collections of these trajectories, as each
solution travels with its own mean phase velocity, and there is no single
co-moving frame that can simultaneously reduce \emph{all} traveling
solutions.

     \emph{emphatically} stationary. ''Covariant frames'' move, but we
     do not know how to use them
     }


\subsection{\Mslices; a local chart}


    \begin{itemize}
      \item closest point on a group orbit
      \item variation $\to$ \slice\ hyperplane
    \end{itemize}

This problem is here resolved by the
{\mslices}\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000,BeTh04,SiCvi10,FrCv11}, in which
the group orbit of any full-flow structure is represented by a single
point (see \reffig{fig:BeThTraj}), the group orbit's intersection with a
fixed hypersurface, or the \emph{`\slice'}.


... the same templates as those used in \refsect{s:cut} to define local
sections of time trajectories...

In the \mslices\ the symmetry reduction is achieved by cutting the group
orbits with a finite set of hyperplanes, one for each continuous group
parameter, with each group orbit of symmetry-equivalent points
represented by a single point, its intersection with the \slice. The
procedure is akin to (but distinct from) cutting across continuous-time
parametrized trajectories by means of Poincar\'e sections. A \PoincSec\
reduces a continuous time orbit to a sequence of points. \Slice, however,
is emphatically \emph{not} a \PoincSec; it replaces a continuous time
orbit ba a symmetry-reduced continuous time orbit.


This paper has two ideas:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item slice locally
  \item chart globally
\end{enumerate}


Symmetries of the flow (i.e.\ the transformations $\LieEl\in\Group$) are
then used to shift and rotate the {\template} $\slicep$ until it
overlies, as well as possible, the state $\ssp$, by minimizing the
distance
\beq
\Norm{\ssp - \LieEl(\gSpace)\,\slicep}
\, .
\ee{minDistance}
The entire group orbit of $\ssp$ is then replaced by the closest match to
the template pattern, given by $\sspRed=\LieEl^{-1}\ssp$. The
symmetry-\reducedsp\ $\pSRed$ (hereafter referred to as the `slice'), of
dimension $(d\!-\!1)$, consists of the set of closest matches $\sspRed$,
one element for each full \statesp\ $\pS$ group orbit; the hat on
$\sspRed$ indicates the unique point on the group orbit of $\ssp$ closest
to the \template\ \slicep.

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


For the reduction of a $\SOn{2}$ symmetry, the minimal distance satisfies
the extremum condition (\reffig{fig:A28extremum})
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial \gSpace} \Norm{\ssp - \LieEl(\gSpace)\,\slicep}^2
   =
2\, \braket{\sspRed - \slicep}{\sliceTan{}}
   = 0
        \,,\quad
\sliceTan{} = \Lg \slicep
\,.
\]
$\Norm{\LieEl(\gSpace)\slicep}$ is a constant, the group tangent vector
$\sliceTan{}$ evaluated at $\slicep$ \refeq{eq:tang} is normal to
$\slicep$, and the term $\braket{\slicep}{\Lg \,\slicep}$ vanishes ($\Lg$
is antisymmetric). Therefore  $\sspRed$, the point on the group orbit that
lands in the \slice, satisfies the \emph{\slice\ condition}
\beq
\braket{\sspRed}{\sliceTan{}} = 0
    \,.
\ee{PCsectQ0}
The \slice\ so defined is thus a hyperplane normal to the \template\
group tangent evaluated at the \template. As the symmetries do not act on
the invariant subspaces, for them $\sliceTan{} = 0$, and they are
contained within all slices.

Conversely, a template has to be equivariant under infinitesimal actions
of the symmetry group in order that the slice is of dimensionality
$(d-N)$. In the choice of the {\template} one should avoid solutions that
belong to the invariant or partially symmetric subspaces; for such
choices $\Lg_{a}\slicep=0$, and some or all $\sliceTan{a}$ vanish
identically and impose no slice conditions. The {\template} $\slicep$
should be a generic \statesp\ point in the sense that its group orbit has
the full $N$ dimensions of the group \Group. The set of the group orbit
points \emph{closest} to the \template\ \slicep\ form an open connected
neighborhood of \slicep, a neighborhood in which each group orbit
intersects the hyperplane \emph{only once}. This neighborhood is
contained in a half-hyperplane, bounded on one side by the intersection
of the hyperplane section with its {\chartBord}.

We refer to this connected open neighborhood
of \slicep\ as a \emph{chart} $\pSRed_{\slicep} \supset \pS/\Group$,
and
to  \refeq{PCsectQ0} as the \emph{slice conditions}.

 \caption{\label{fig:slice}
The \mslices, a \statesp\ visualization:
(a)
\Slice\ $\pSRed \supset \pS/\Group$ lies in the $(d\!-\!N)$\dmn\
hyperplane \refeq{PCsectQ0} normal to $\sliceTan{}$, where $\sliceTan{j}$
span the  $N$\dmn\ space tangent to the group orbit $\LieEl\,\slicep$
(dotted line) evaluated at the {\template} point $\slicep$. The
hyperplane intersects {all} full \statesp\ group orbits (green
dashes).  This is a highly idealized sketch: A group orbit is a $N$\dmn\
manifold, and even for $\SOn{2}$ it is usually only topologically a
circle, and can intersect a hyperplane
any number of times  (see \reffigs{fig:sliceimage}{fig:chartBord}). The full \statesp\
trajectory $\ssp(\zeit)$ (blue) and the \reducedsp\ trajectory
$\sspRed(\zeit)$ (green) are equivalent up to a `moving frame' rotation
$\ssp(\zeit)=\LieEl(\zeit)\,\sspRed(\zeit)$, where $\LieEl(\zeit)$ is a
shorthand for $\LieEl(\gSpace(\zeit))$.
(b)
In the full \statesp\ a \rpo\ $\ssp(0) \to \ssp(\zeit) \to
\ssp(\period{})$ returns to the group orbit of $\ssp(0)$ after time
$\period{}$ and a rotation by $\LieEl$,  $\ssp(0)=\LieEl \, \ssp
(\period{})$. A generic \rpo\ fills out quasi-\-periodically what is
topologically a torus (\reffig{fig:CLf01group}). In the \slice\ $\pSRed$
the symmetry-reduced orbit is periodic, $\sspRed(0) =
\sspRed(\period{})$.
 }
 \end{figure}


When $\ssp$ is varies in time, $\dot{\ssp}=\vel(\ssp)$, the {\template}
$\slicep$ tracks the motion using the slice condition \refeq{PCsectQ0} to
minimize $\Norm{\ssp(\zeit)-\LieEl(\theta(\zeit))\slicep}$, and the
full-space trajectory $\ssp(\zeit)$ is thus rotated into the
{\reducedsp}, $\sspRed(\zeit) = \LieEl^{-1}\,\ssp(\zeit)$, by appropriate
\emph{moving frame} angles $\{\gSpace(\zeit)\}$, as depicted in
\reffig{fig:slice}\,{(a)}. Specializing to $\SOn{2}$, one can write
the equations for the \reducedsp\ flow, $\dot{\sspRed} =
\velRed(\sspRed)$, confined to the \slice, $\sspRed(\zeit) \in \pSRed$,
as
\bea
\velRed(\sspRed) &=& \vel(\sspRed)
     \,-\, \dot{\gSpace}(\sspRed) \, \groupTan(\sspRed)
\label{EqMotMFrame}\\
\dot{\gSpace}(\sspRed) &=& \braket{\vel(\sspRed)}{\sliceTan{}}
                       /\braket{\groupTan(\sspRed)}{\sliceTan{}}
\,.
\label{reconstrEq}
\eea
In other words, $\vel$, the velocity in the full \statesp, can be written
as the sum of $\velRed$, the velocity component in the \slice, and
$\dot{\gSpace}\,\groupTan$,
the velocity component within the group tangent space. The
$\dot{\gSpace}$ equation is called the {\em reconstruction equation}, as
its integral keeps track of the group shift in the full \statesp. In
particular, if  \sspRed\ is a point on a \reqv\ \refeq{phaseVel}, the
full \statesp\ velocity equals the phase velocity, and $\velRed(\sspRed)
= 0$, \ie, \reqva\ are always reduced to \eqva\ in the \reducedsp.

\subsection{What it is not}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item co-moving frame
      \item reduced-dimensionality model: Symmetry reduction is not a
          dimensional-reduction scheme, or flow modeling by fewer degrees
          of freedom: it is a local change of coordinate, with one (or
          $N$) coordinates pointing along the phase directions. The
          $(d\!-\!N)$\dmn\ \reducedsp\ is also $\infty$-dimensional and
          no information is lost, one can go freely between solutions in
          the full and reduced \statesp s by integrating the associated
          {reconstruction equations} \refeq{reconstrEq}.
