\section{Poincar\'e sections}
\label{s:cut}

In the {\em Poincar\'e section method} one records the coordinates of a
trajectory at the instant it traverses an oriented fixed hypersurface
$\PoincS$ of codimension 1. For high-dimensional flows that we have in
mind the only feasible choice is a hyperplane, the type of Poincar\'e
section (or, from now on, just a `section')  we shall consider in this
paper. Such section is almost always only local, and should
capture important features of the flow in an open neighborhood of the
section-fixing \template.

the inner {\eqv} $\ssp_{-}$  is 1-dimensional and the unstable one is a

spiral-in focus and the unstable manifold is 1-dimensional.

As an example consider the system of R\"ossler\rf{ross},
\index{R\"ossler system}
\beq
\begin{split}
  \dot{x} &= -x \,-\,z \\
  \dot{y} &= x + a y \\
  \dot{z} &= b + z (x - c)
  \,,
  \label{eq:Rossler}
\end{split}
\eeq
where $a = b = 0.2$ and $c = 5.7$. This flow has two prominent invariant states,
the `inner' unstable \eqv\ $\ssp_{-}$ and the `outer' $\ssp_{+}$ (\reffig{fig:AmLeAg06Im1})
    \PC{ Draw (un)stable eigenvectors as in \reffig{fig:AmLeAg06Im1}.
    Also, run the unstable spiral(s) for the upper brunch further out, to
    trace out the basin boundary.}
that we pick them as {\em
\template s}, points through which the sections go. We orient the first section
(\reffig{fig:RoessSct1}) so the section plane $\PoincS_{-}$ contains the
1\dmn\ stable eigenvector, and the other section $\PoincS_{+}$ contains the
1\dmn\ unstable eigenvector (\reffig{fig:RoessSct2}), thus
capturing locally all of the spiral-in, spiral-out dynamics. The
remaining freedom to rotate each section can be used to orient them in
such a fashion that the Euclidean distance from the first \template\ to
the ridge (intersection of the two sections, indicated by the brown line
in individual sections of the preceding figures), and then to the second
\template\ is approximately minimized (\reffig{fig:RoessSctAtlas}).

How far does the neighborhood of a {\template} extend along the hyperplane
\refeq{lincond}?

A section captures faithfully neighboring orbits as
long as it cuts them transversally; it fails the moment the velocity
field at point $\sspRSing$ fails to pierce the section. At this location
the velocity either vanishes (\eqv) or is tangent to the section and, thus, orthogonal to the
\template\ normal $\hat{n}$,
\beq
    \hat{n} \cdot \vel(\sspRSing) = 0
\,,\qquad
    \sspRSing \in S
\,,
\ee{eq:sspRSing}
\ie, $\vel_\perp(\sspRed)$, component of the $\vel(\sspRed)$ normal to
the section, vanishes at $\sspRSing$. For a smooth flow such points form
a smooth $(d\!-\!2)$\dmn\ \emph{\poincBord} ${\cal S} \subset \PoincS$,
encompassing the open neighborhood of the {\template} characterized by
qualitatively similar flow. This region of the section
hyperplane comprises the chart of the {\template} neighborhood.

In general there are two strategies for replacing a continuous-time flow
by iterated mappings; by cutting it by Poincar\'e sections, or by
\emph{strobing} it at a sequence of instants in time. While
`strobing' is what any numerical integrator does, by representing a
trajectory by a sequence of time-integration step separated points,
strobing is in general not a reduction of a flow, as the sequence of
strobed points still resides in the full \statesp\ $\pS$, of
dimensionality $d$.

A Poincar\'e section is {\em not} a projection onto a lower-dimensional
space: Rather, it is a local change of coordinates to a direction along
the flow, and the remaining coordinates (spanning the section) transverse
to it. No information about the flow is lost; the full space trajectory
can always be reconstructed by integration from the nearest point in the
section.


An example of a wurst is the set of group orbits traced out by a single
short \rpo\ in \reffig{fig:CLf01group}. As \cLe\ exhibits only the simplest,
$m=1$ Fourier mode, all group orbits are circles, which appear elliptical in
most $d=5 \to 3$~dimensions projections.
    \PC{define \cLe, refer to \reffig{fig:CLf01group}}
    \color{black}\fi

Any state in the  group orbit set $\pS_{\ssp}$
is physically equivalent to any other. The action of a symmetry group
thus stratifies the \statesp\ into a union of group orbits,
\reffig{fig:BeThTraj}\,{(a)}.

\subsection{Norms - distances between states}

We have seen that in presence of the continuous $\SOn{2}$ symmetry
\reqva\ and \rpo s are 2- and 3-dimensional manifolds of physically
equivalent states. How are we to compare a pair of such states? We shall
do this here by determining the minimal distance between them.

In order to quantify
whether two fluid states are close to or far from each other, one
needs a notion of distance between two points in \statesp, measured
here as
\beq
  \Norm{\ssp-\ssp'}^2  = \braket{\ssp-\ssp'}{\ssp-\ssp'} =
\frac{1}{V}
\int_\bCell \! d \bx \;
(\vec{u}-\vec{u}') \cdot (\vec{u}-\vec{u}')
\,,
\ee{innerproduct}
invariant under all symmetries of the flow,
$\Norm{\ssp-\LieEl\,\slicep}=\Norm{\sspRed-\slicep}$
There is no compelling reason to use this {`energy norm'}, other than
that velocity fields is what is generated in a numerical
computation. What norm one actually uses depends very much on the
application; the importance (and arbitrariness) of the choice of
norm cannot be overemphasized. For example, in the study of `optimal perturbations' that
move a laminar solution to a turbulent one, both energy
\citep{TeHaHe10} and dissipation \citep{LoCaCoPeGo11} norms have been
used.
For experimental data sets, pattern recognition type norms could be the
only practical option\rf{MakeThisUp}.

\subsection{\Statesp\ visualization}

On perils of thinking linearly: bases such as Fourier modes are
perfectly natural for problems such a bifurcation of a steady state, and
other weak perturbations. They are absolutely unnatural for strongly
nonlinear problems, with many Fourier modes of comparable magnitude and
strongly entangled.
