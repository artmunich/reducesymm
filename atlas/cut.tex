\label{s:cut}

In the \mslices\ the symmetry reduction is achieved by cutting the group
orbits with a finite set of hyperplanes, one for each continuous group
parameter, with each group orbit of
symmetry-equivalent points represented by a single point, its
intersection with the \slice.


\subsection{Local chart}
After some experimentation and observations of turbulence in a given
flow, one can identify a set of dynamically important unstable
{\recurrStr s}.  For example, coherent streaky structures have been
observed in pipe flow where `very large scale motions' have
length scales comparable to the pipe radius.
