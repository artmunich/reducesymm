\section{\Statesp\ visualization}

\subsection{Group orbit}

The \emph{group orbit} $\pS_\ssp $ of a \statesp\ point $\ssp \in \pS$ is
traced out by the set of all group actions
\beq
\pS_\ssp = \{\LieEl\,\ssp \mid \LieEl \in {\Group}\}
% \,,\qquad \pS_\ssp \subset \pS
\,.
\ee{sspOrbit}
Any state in the  group orbit set $\pS_{\ssp}$
is physically equivalent to any other. The action of a symmetry group
thus foliates the \statesp\ into a union of group orbits,
\reffig{fig:BeThTraj}\,(a).

\section{Poincar\'e sections, R\"ossler}
\label{s:cut}

In the \mslices\ the symmetry reduction is achieved by cutting the group
orbits with a finite set of hyperplanes, one for each continuous group
parameter, with each group orbit of
symmetry-equivalent points represented by a single point, its
intersection with the \slice.


\subsection{Local chart}
After some experimentation and observations of turbulence in a given
flow, one can identify a set of dynamically important unstable
{\recurrStr s}.
