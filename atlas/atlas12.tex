Symmetry reduction by the method of slices quotients the continuous
symmetries of chaotic flows. Within the symmetry reduced state space,
relative equilibria reduce to equilibria, and relative periodic orbits reduce to
periodic orbits. Visualizations of these solutions and their unstable
manifolds reveal their interrelations and the role they play in
organizing turbulence / chaos.

Today it is possible to take a stroll through 61,506\dmn\ \statesp\ of
hydrodynamic turbulence. Charting this world is a geometer's task, and we
will map it using a measuring tape, but first one has to deal with
symmetries. Physicists have come to love them inordinately, but Nature
less so: even though the governing equations are symmetric, turbulence
breaks all symmetries, and rather than simplifying our task, for
nonlinear dynamics symmetries obscure the essential dynamics. Evolution
in time decomposes the \statesp\ into spaghetti of time trajectories,
continuous spatial symmetries stratify it into layers of an onion. There
exist many excellent methods that quotient out symmetries of
low-dimensional systems, but so far only one, \mslices, can be mustered
for extremely high-dimensional flows of turbulent fields. In this
geometrical tour of dynamics we cut this knot and pick a
single point for each trajectory (section it) and each group orbit (slice
it). Once the fog of symmetries is out of the way, one can identify and
describe the prominent fluid structures by taxonomy of its invariant
building blocks: numerically exact solutions of \NSe, finite sets of
\reqva\ and infinite hierarchies of \rpo s, and describe the dynamics in
terms of their heteroclinic connections.

\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

%%    \DB{2012-04-12}{this is an example how I can alert the co-authors to
%%    a significant edit}

Over the last decade, new insights into the dynamics of moderate
\Reynolds\ turbulent flows have been gained through visualizations of
their $\infty$-dimensional \statesp s by means of dynamically invariant,
representation independent coordinate frames\rf{GHCW07} constructed from
physically prominent unstable {\cohStr s}, hereafter referred to as {\em
\template s}.
The most recent advance within this new framework is
the first determination of \rpo s that in part shape turbulence observed
in pipe flows\rf{ACHKW11}. Navigating and charting the geometry of these
extremely high-dimensional \statesp s necessitates a reexamination of two
of the basic tools of the theory of dynamical systems: \PoincSec s and symmetry
reduction\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000,BeTh04,SiCvi10,FrCv11}. We strive
here to explain the key geometrical ideas in simple but illustrative
settings, eschewing the fluid dynamical and group theoretical
technicalities.

A flow $\map^t$ and the \statesp\ $\pS$ on which the flow acts comprise a
{dynamical system}. If a group $\Group$ of continuous transformations
acts on a continuous time flow, each \statesp\ point owns a set of
tangent vectors (\reffig{fig:A27wurst}\,(a)). Integrated globally, the
velocity vector $\vel(\ssp)$ traces out the {\em trajectory}
$\flow{\zeit}{\ssp}$ ( \reffig{fig:A27wurst}\,(b)). Applying the continuous
transformations traces out the {group orbit} (or, from now on, just
\emph{orbit})
\(
\pS_\ssp = \{\LieEl\,\ssp \mid \LieEl \in {\Group}\}
% \,,\qquad \pS_\ssp \subset \pS
\,
\) %ee{sspOrbit}
(\reffig{fig:A27wurst}\,(c)). Together they trace out a complicated smooth
manifold (hereafter affectionately referred to as the {\em wurst}, see
figures~\ref{fig:A27wurst}\,(d), \ref{fig:CLf01group}\,(b) and
\ref{fig:sliceimage}), that we shall teach you here how to slice.

A flow is said to have symmetry $\Group$ if the form of evolution
equations $\dot{\ssp} = \vel(\ssp)$ is left invariant,
\(
\vel(\ssp)=\LieEl^{-1} \, \vel(\LieEl \, \ssp)
% \,,\qquad \mbox{for all }
\,,
\) %ee{eq:FiniteRot}
by the set of transformations $\LieEl \in {\Group}$. Physicists love
symmetry, but Nature does not care: turbulence breaks all symmetries,
and while the flow equations may be invariant under $\Group$, their
solutions typically are not.

The key to chaotic dynamics is the notion of recurrence. To quantify how
close the state of the system now is to a previously visited state, we
need the notion of distance between two points in \statesp. The simplest
(but far from the only, or the most natural) is the Euclidean norm
\beq
  \Norm{\ssp-\ssp'}^2  = \braket{\ssp-\ssp'}{\ssp-\ssp'} =
\sum_j^d
(\ssp-\ssp')_j^2
\,.
\ee{innerproduct}
Given a notion of distance we can talk about 'neighborhood,' the open set of
nearby states. Our main task in what follows will be to make this precise,
by defining a chart over a neighborhood, and its borders.
Given distances and neighborhoods,
the next key notion is  \emph{measure}, or how likely a typical
trajectory is to visit a given neighborhood. After some observations of a
given turbulent flow, one can identify a set of representative
\emph{\template s}\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000}, {points}
$\slicep{}^{(j)}$, $j=1,2,\cdots$ in the \statesp\ $\pS$, which are the
dynamically most important unstable {\recurrStr s} of the flow. 

Our goals here are two-fold:
(i) In \refsect{s:cut} we review the method of \PoincSec s, with
    emphasis on aspects applicable to high-dimensional flows: construction of
    multiple local linear `charts' and determination of their borders followed by a brief study of continuous symmetries in \refsect{s:symm}. 
(ii) In \refsect{s:slice} we show how the same set of tools applied to
    reduction of continuous symmetries enables us to commence a
    systematic charting of the long-time dynamics of high-dimensional
    flows with continuous symmetries (\refsect{s:chart}).


\section{Section}
\label{s:cut}

In the {\em \PoincSec} method one records the coordinates
$\sspRed_n$ of the trajectory $\ssp(\zeit)$ at the instants $\zeit_n$
when it traverses a fixed oriented hypersurface $\PoincS$ of codimension
1. For high-dimensional flows that we have in mind, the practical choice
is a hyperplane, the only type of \PoincSec\ (from now on, just a
\emph{section}) we shall consider here. Such a section captures
important features of the flow in an open neighborhood of the
section-fixing \template.

As an example consider the system of R\"ossler\rf{ross},
\index{R\"ossler system}
\beq
\begin{split}
  \dot{x} &= -y \,-\,z \\
  \dot{y} &= x + a y \\
  \dot{z} &= b + z (x - c)
  \,,
  \label{eq:Rossler}
\end{split}
\eeq
where $a = b = 0.2$ and $c = 5.7$. This flow has two prominent invariant
states, the `inner' and the `outer' unstable \eqva\ $\slicep{}^{(-)}$  and
$\slicep{}^{(+)}$, which we pick as {\em \template s} (\refFig{fig:RoessTrjs}).

We orient the sections so the plane $\PoincS_{-}$ contains the 1\dmn\
stable eigenvector of $\slicep{}^{(-)}$ (\reffig{fig:RoessTrjs}\,(b)),
and the other section $\PoincS_{+}$ contains the 1\dmn\ unstable
eigenvector of $\slicep{}^{(+)}$ (\reffig{fig:RoessFarEq}\,(a)), thus
capturing the local spiral-in, spiral-out dynamics. The remaining freedom
to rotate each section can be used to orient them in such a way that the
ridge (the intersection of the two sections) lies approximately
between the two templates (\reffig{fig:RoessFarEq}\,(b)).

A well chosen section captures the dynamics in the neighborhood of its
\template, but how far does this neighborhood extend?
The answer is that the section captures neighboring trajectories as long
as it cuts them transversally; it fails the moment the velocity field at
a point $\sspRSing$ fails to pierce the section. At these locations, the
velocity either vanishes (\eqv) or is tangent to the section, \ie,
orthogonal to the section normal $\hat{n}$,
\beq
    \hat{n} \cdot \vel(\sspRSing) = 0
\,,\qquad
    \sspRSing \in \cal{S}
\,.
\ee{eq:sspRSing}
For a smooth flow such points form a smooth $(d\!-\!2)$\dmn\
\emph{\poincBord} ${\cal S} \subset \PoincS$, which encloses the open
neighborhood of the {\template} characterized by qualitatively similar
flow. We shall refer to this region of the section as a `chart' of the
{\template} neighborhood (see
\reffig{fig:RoessTrjs}\,(b) and \reffig{fig:RoessFarEq}). Beyond the border, the flow
pierces the section hyperplane in the `wrong' direction and the dynamics
are qualitatively different.

either fall into the chaotic attractor, or escape to infinity) and the

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For R\"ossler flow, the border condition \refeq{eq:sspRSing} yields a
quadratic condition in 3 dimensions, so \poincBord s\ drawn in
\reffig{fig:RoessTrjs}\,(b) and \reffig{fig:RoessFarEq} are conic
sections. The two charts meet at a ridge, and together do a pretty good
job as the 2-chart atlas of the interesting R\"ossler dynamics,
\reffig{fig:RoessFarEq}. As explained in ChaosBook.org\cite{DasBuch}, due
to extreme contraction rate, the section in \reffig{fig:RoessTrjs}\,(b)
is for all practical purposes 1\dmn, and the associated return map yields
all \po s of the 3\dmn\ flow.

In 3 dimensions everything -sections, ridges, \poincBord s- can be
drawn, and a $\chi\alpha\rho\tau\eta\varsigma$ does fit on a sheet of
papyrus. But what about high-dimensional flows? The point of the
cartography enterprize undertaken here is that while it is impossible to
visualize  61,504% 61,506-2 $(d\!-\!2)$
\dmn\ {\poincBord} of the 61,505% 61,506-1 $(d\!-\!1)$
\dmn\ slab that is now our chart\rf{GibsonMovies}, a point is a point,
and a line is a line in a projection from any number of dimensions, so a
trajectory crossing of both a section and a {\poincBord} can be easily
determined and visualized in any dimension.

To summarize:
Evolution in time decomposes the \statesp\ into a spaghetti of 1\dmn\
trajectories $\ssp(\zeit)$, each determined by a single point $\ssp(0)$
on it. A well chosen set of \emph{sections} of codimension 1 allows us to
`quotient' the continuous time parameter $\zeit$. For unstable
trajectories one needs, in addition, a notion of recurrence to the
section. The set of points $\{\sspRed_n\} = \{\ssp(\zeit_n)\}$,  separated
by short-time section to section flights, then captures the transverse
dynamics without losing any information about the chaotic flow.
We can thus chart the regions of \statesp\ of interest, by a picking a
sufficient number of \template s and the associated charts over their
neighborhoods, each bounded by \poincBord s and ridges.

Two concluding remarks on what sections \emph{are not}:

(1) A \PoincSec\ is {\em not} a projection onto a
lower-dimensional space: Rather, it is a local change of coordinates to a
direction along the flow $\vel(\sspRed)$, and the remaining coordinates
transverse to it. No information about the flow is lost; the full space
trajectory can always be reconstructed by integration from its point
$\sspRed$ in the section.

(2) The method of \PoincSec s is {\em not} equivalent to
\emph{strobing} a flow at a sequence of instants in time. While
`strobing' is what any numerical integrator does, by representing a
trajectory by a sequence of time-integration step separated points, this
is no reduction of a flow to a codimension 1 manifold, as the sequence of
strobed points still resides in the full \statesp\ $\pS$, of
dimensionality $d$.

%% A27*-pipeSymms.* %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

What is a symmetry? A visualization of the fluid dynamics of a pipe flow,
\reffig{fig:A27-pipeSymms}, affords an intuitive illustration. Solutions
of pipe flow remain physically the same under azimuthal rotations and
stream-wise translations (which become \SOn{2} rotations in numerical
stream-wise periodic pipes) but correspond to different points in
\statesp\ and may look very different in its visualizations.

Each \SOn{2} group orbit is topologically a circle, but it traces out a
complicated \statesp\ curve composed of many Fourier modes nonlinearly
coupled and thus of comparable magnitudes. Together
the two \SOn{2} sweep out contorted and hard to visualize $T^2$ tori (see
\refref{ACHKW11}), but we shall illustrate here the key ideas by a much
simpler example, the $\SOn{2}$-equivariant Gibbon and
McGuinness\rf{GibMcCLE82,FowlerCLE82} \cLe\ of geophysics and laser
physics,
\bea
	\dot{x}_1 &=& -\sigma x_1 + \sigma y_1
        \,,\qquad
	\dot{x}_2 \,=\, -\sigma x_2 + \sigma y_2
        \continue
	\dot{y}_1 &=& (\RerCLor-z) x_1 - \ImrCLor x_2 -y_1-e y_2 \continue
	\dot{y}_2 &=& \ImrCLor x_1 + (\RerCLor-z) x_2 + e y_1- y_2\continue
	\dot{z} \; &=& -b z + x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2

Here the parameters are set to Siminos's values $\RerCLor=28,\,
\ImrCLor=0,\, b=8/3,\, \sigma=10,\, e= 1/10$. (For the background and an

The strange attractor of the \cLf\ is shown in
\reffig{fig:CLf01group}\,(a). It is a mess! Why? The problem of dynamics
in presence of symmetry can perhaps be understood this way: dissipative
flows settle into solutions with low friction. Since drifting along the
non-shape-changing symmetry directions is energetically cheap, rather
than do work, solutions tend to drift along. Thus, the physically
important shape-changing dynamics are smeared out in favor of a ``downhill drift'' along the symmetry.
%DB 4/13/2012: I think this is the general idea, but not sure how much of a claim this is
    \KC{2012-04-13}{I do not understand the paragraph. Predrag: did
                    Daniel's edit help? Keith: yes}

A continuous symmetry leads to drifting invariant solutions. A {\em
\reqv} (traveling wave, rotational wave, ...) is a trajectory whose
velocity field lies within the group tangent space, such that
\(
\vel(\ssp) = c \cdot \groupTan(\ssp)
\) %\label{phaseVel}
with a constant {\phaseVel} $c$, and whose time evolution is thus
confined to the group orbit; think of an unchanging body carried by a
stream.

A {\em \rpo} $\pS_p$ is a trajectory which exactly recurs
\beq
\ssp(\zeit) = \LieEl_p \, \ssp(\zeit + \period{p} )
    \,,\qquad
\ssp(\zeit) \in \pS_p
\ee{RPOrelper1}
after a fixed {relative period} $\period{p}$, but shifted by a fixed
group action ${\LieEl}$ that maps the endpoint $\ssp (\period{p}) $ back
into the initial point cycle point $\ssp (0) $; think of a dancer moving
across the stage through a set of motions and then striking the initial
pose\rf{ShWi06}, or study the pipe flow sketches \reffig{fig:A27-pipeSymms}.

As the $\SOn{2}$ transformations act on the \cLf\ only through the
simplest, $m=1$ Fourier mode, here all group orbits are circles, and appear
elliptical in most $d=5 \to 3$~dimensions projections. Nevertheless, even
the wurst traced out by the very simplest, short \rpo\ $\cycle{01}$ shown
in \reffig{fig:CLf01group}\,(b) is not so easy to get one's head around:
you are looking at a 3\dmn\ projection of a \emph{torus} embedded in 5
dimensions.

To summarize: continuous symmetries of dynamics stratify the \statesp\
into an onion, each layer a group orbit (\reffig{fig:BeThMovFr}). We are
free to replace a given flow $\ssp(\zeit)$ by another, physically
equivalent flow $\ssp(\zeit)=\LieEl(\zeit)\,\sspRed(\zeit)$ by any, in
general, time dependent {\em moving
frame}\rf{FelsOlver98,FelsOlver99,OlverInv} transformation
$\LieEl(\zeit)$. For example, to film our dancer we can mount the camera
on a cart moving alongside her. So, in the presence of continuous symmetries,
there are two kinds of changes in time: a dancer, continuously changing
shapes, or a drifter, merely shuffling along the easy, shape invariant directions. We will presently banish the drifters, and just enjoy the
dance.

$\sspSing$ normal to \refeq{sliceSingl0}, the quadratic Casimir-weighted

$(d\!-\!2)$\dmn\ hyperplane {\em \chartBord} $\sspRSing \in {\cal S}$, within
which all group tangents $\groupTan(\sspRSing)$ lie in the slice and are
thus normal to $\sliceTan{}$. Beyond this boundary, the group orbits
pierce the \slice\ hyperplane in the wrong direction, so only the
half-hyperplane that contains the \template\ belongs to the slice. The
{\chartBord} is not easy to visualize; For the lack of dimensions, here
it is drawn here as a `line,' the $z$ axis in this 3\dmn\ sketch. (a) If
the equivariant coordinates transform only under the $m=1$ representation
of $\SOn{2}$, every group orbit is a circle, and crosses any
hyperplane twice. However, if there are coordinates that transform as
higher $m$, group orbit can pierce the hyperplane up to $2m$ times, and
the {\chartBord} lies closer to the template. (b) For example, a group
orbit for a combination of $m=1$ and $m=2$ equivariant coordinates
resembles a baseball seam, and can be sliced 4 times, out of which only
the point closest to the \template\ is in the slice (from \wwwcb{}).

Suppose your day job is computing invariant solutions of \NSe. Do you
really want to compute the same solution over and over again, for every
point on the group orbit? No, you would like to compute it only once. The
rule that picks out that one solution is called \emph{symmetry
reduction}. Its goal is to replace each group orbit by a unique point in
a lower-dimensional symmetry-\reducedsp\ $\pSRed = \pS/\Group$, as
sketched in \reffig{fig:BeThTraj}.

What is a smart way to go about it? Intuition gained from pipe flow (see
\reffig{fig:A27-pipeSymms}), will again prove helpful. A turbulent flow
exhibits a myriad of unstable structures, all traveling down the pipe,
each with its own {\phaseVel}. The
\mslices\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000,BeTh04,SiCvi10,FrCv11} that we now
describe tells you how to pull each solution back into a {\em fixed}
frame, the \slice, and there compare it to your repertoire of precomputed
solutions, the \template s $\{\slicep{}^{(j)}\}$, by a very geometrical
principle of the closest distance to each. What follows is very much like
the construction of sections of \refsect{s:cut}; due to the linear action
of the symmetry group, slicing is easier than sectioning, but is wholly
unfamiliar - that is why we warmed up by reviewing the \PoincSec s. We
now offer a pictorial tour of this, save for the one bold
incursion\rf{ACHKW11}, hitherto unchartered territory.

First, pick a \template\ $\slicep$ and use the freedom to choose a
moving frame (\reffig{fig:BeThMovFr}\,(b)) to shift and rotate $\slicep$
until it overlies, as well as possible, the state $\ssp$, by minimizing
the distance
\beq
\Norm{\ssp - \LieEl(\gSpace)\,\slicep}
\, .
\ee{minDistance}
The entire group orbit of $\ssp$ is then replaced by the closest match to
the template pattern, given by $\sspRed=\LieEl^{-1}\ssp$. The
symmetry-\reducedsp\ $\pSRed$ is comprised of such closest matches
$\sspRed$, a point for each full \statesp\ group orbit; the hat on
$\sspRed$ indicates the unique point on the group orbit of $\ssp$ closest
to the \template\ \slicep.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


The minimal distance satisfies
the extremum condition (\reffig{fig:A28extremum})
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial \gSpace} \Norm{\ssp - \LieEl(\gSpace)\,\slicep}^2
   =
2\, \braket{\sspRed - \slicep}{\sliceTan{}}
   = 0
        \,,\quad
\sliceTan{} = \Lg \slicep
\,,
\]
where the $[d\!\times\!d]$ matrix $\Lg$ is the generator of infinitesimal
symmetry transformations. $\Norm{\LieEl(\gSpace)\slicep}$ is a constant,
the group tangent vector $\sliceTan{}$ evaluated at $\slicep$
is normal to $\slicep$, and the term
$\braket{\slicep}{\Lg \,\slicep}$ vanishes ($\Lg$ is antisymmetric).
Therefore  $\sspRed$, the point on the group orbit of $\ssp$ that lands
in the \slice, satisfies the \emph{\slice\ condition}
\beq
\braket{\sspRed}{\sliceTan{}} = 0
    \,.
\ee{PCsectQ0}
The \slice\ so defined is thus a $(d\!-\!N)$\dmn\ hyperplane normal to
the $N$ group tangents evaluated at the \slicep. This is sketched in
\reffig{fig:slice}, in a highly idealized manner: A group orbit is a
$N$\dmn\ manifold and even for $\SOn{2}$ it is usually only topologically
a circle, and can intersect a hyperplane any number of times  (see
\reffigs{fig:sliceimage}{fig:chartBord}).

The \mslices, a \statesp\ visualization:
(a)
\Slice\ $\pSRed \supset \pS/\Group$ lies in the $(d\!-\!N)$\dmn\
hyperplane \refeq{PCsectQ0} normal to $\sliceTan{j}$, which
span the $N$\dmn\ space tangent to the group orbit $\LieEl\,\slicep$
(dotted line) evaluated at the {\template} point $\slicep$. The
hyperplane intersects {all} full \statesp\ group orbits (green
dashes).  The full \statesp\
trajectory $\ssp(\zeit)$ (blue) and the \reducedsp\ trajectory
$\sspRed(\zeit)$ (green) are equivalent up to a `moving frame' rotation
$\ssp(\zeit)=\LieEl(\zeit)\,\sspRed(\zeit)$, where $\LieEl(\zeit)$ is a
shorthand for $\LieEl(\gSpace(\zeit))$.
(b)
In the full \statesp\ a \rpo\ $\ssp(0) \to \ssp(\zeit) \to
\ssp(\period{})$ returns to the group orbit of $\ssp(0)$ after time
$\period{}$ and a rotation by $\LieEl$,  $\ssp(0)=\LieEl \, \ssp
(\period{})$. A generic \rpo\ quasi-\-periodically fills out what is
topologically a torus (\reffig{fig:CLf01group}\,(b)). In the \slice\ $\pSRed$
the symmetry-reduced trajectory is periodic, $\sspRed(0) =
\sspRed(\period{})$.
 }\label{fig:slice}
 \end{figure}

As $\ssp$ varies in time, the {\template} $\slicep$ tracks the motion
using the slice condition \refeq{PCsectQ0} to minimize
$\Norm{\ssp(\zeit)-\LieEl(\phi(\zeit))\slicep}$, and the full-space
trajectory $\ssp(\zeit)$ is thus rotated into the {\reducedsp} $\pSRed$
by appropriate time varying \emph{moving frame} angles
$\{\gSpace(\zeit)\}$, as depicted in \reffig{fig:slice}\,{(a)}. One can
write the equations for the flow in the \reducedsp\, $\dot{\sspRed} =
\velRed(\sspRed)$, which confine the motion to the \slice,
$\sspRed(\zeit) \in \pSRed$, as
\bea
\velRed(\sspRed) &=& \vel(\sspRed)
     \,-\, \dot{\gSpace}(\sspRed) \, \groupTan(\sspRed)
\label{EqMotMFrame}\\
\dot{\gSpace}(\sspRed) &=& \braket{\vel(\sspRed)}{\sliceTan{}}
                       /\braket{\groupTan(\sspRed)}{\sliceTan{}}
\,.
\label{reconstrEq}
\eea
Thus the dynamical system $\{\pS,\map^t\}$ with continuous symmetry
\Group\ is replaced by the {\reducedsp} dynamics $\{\pSRed,\mapRed^t\}$:
with the velocity in the full \statesp\ $\vel$ the sum of $\velRed$, the
velocity component in the \slice, and $\dot{\gSpace}\,\groupTan$, the
velocity component along the group tangent space. The integral of the
{\em reconstruction equation} $\dot{\gSpace}$ keeps track of the group
shift in the full \statesp.

The {\template} $\slicep$ should be a generic \statesp\ point in the
sense that its group orbit has the full $N$ dimensions of the group
\Group. The set of the group orbit points \emph{closest} to the
\template\ \slicep\ forms a neighborhood of \slicep\ in which each group
orbit intersects the hyperplane \emph{only once}. A \slice\ hyperplane
captures neighboring group orbits until, for a point $\sspRSing$ not so
close to the \template, the group tangent vector lies in the \slice. The
group orbits for such points are grazed tangentially rather than sliced
transversally, much like what happens at the \poincBord\
\refeq{eq:sspRSing} for evolution in time. This is also a linear

comes along with its own \slice\ hyperplane $\pSRed{}^{(2)}$. Any pair of
$(d\!-\!1)$\dmn\ local \slice\ hyperplanes intersects in a \emph{ridge},
a $(d\!-\!2)$\dmn\ hyperplane {\PoincS} (drawn in
\reffig{fig:A29-2slices}\,({\it c}) as a `line' and in
\reffig{fig:A29-1ridge} as a `plane' of intersection of two volumes)
shared by a pair of charts and thus satisfies both \slice\ conditions

\ee{ridge}
We shall refer to the neighborhood of a \template\ \slicep\ bounded by
its {\chartBord} and the ridges to other such linear neighborhoods as a
\emph{chart} $\pSRed_{\slicep} \supset \pS/\Group$, and to
\refeq{sliceSingl0} and \refeq{ridge} as the \emph{border conditions}.
%    \DB{2012-04-13}{\refeq{sliceSingl0} is more restrictive than

\section{Charting the \slice}
\label{s:chart}

Let us summarize the voyage so far: We are charting a curved manifold,
and it would be nice to use tools of differential geometry, but try it in
61,506~dimensions. The only feasible way to do chart this space is to (1)
quotient all continuous symmetries, and (2) tile it with
$(61,506-N-1)$\dmn\ tiles, or `charts'. Here are our tools:

\noindent\textbf{\Template.}
Pick a {\template} $\slicep \in \pS$ such that $\Group$ acts on it
regularly, \ie, whose group orbit is of dimension $N$.

\noindent\textbf{\Slice\ hyperplane:}
The $(d\!-\!N)$-dimensional hyperplane
\( %beq
\braket{\sspRed}{\sliceTan{a}}=0
\,.
\) %\ee{PCsectQ1}
\index{slice}

\noindent\textbf{Moving frame.}
For any $\ssp$, the slice condition  \refeq{PCsectQ0} on $\ssp =
\LieEl(\gSpace)\sspRed$ determines the moving frame, \ie, the group
action $\LieEl(\gSpace)$ that brings $ \ssp$ into the \slice.
\index{moving frame}

\noindent\textbf{\ChartBord.}
The set of points in slice hyperplane whose group orbits are grazed
tangentially rather than sliced transversally; a hyperplane in which both
points $\sspRSing$ and their group tangents $\groupTan(\sspRSing)$ lie in
the {\slice}, $\braket{\sspRSing}{\sliceTan{}} \,=\, 0$ and
$\braket{\groupTan(\sspRSing)}{\sliceTan{}} \,=\, 0 \,.$
%\label{sliceSingl0}

\noindent\textbf{Ridge.}
Any pair of \slice\ hyperplanes $\pSRed{}^{(1)}$ and $\pSRed{}^{(2)}$
intersects in a {ridge}, a hyperplane {\PoincS} shared by a pair of
charts,
\(
\braket{\sspRed^*}{\sliceTan{}{}^{(1)}} = 0
\mbox{ and }
\braket{\sspRed^*}{\sliceTan{}{}^{(2)}} = 0
    \,.
\) %ee{ridge}

\noindent\textbf{Chart.}
The neighborhood of a \template\ \slicep\ bounded by its {\chartBord} and
the ridges to other such linear neighborhoods comprises a \emph{chart}
$\pSRed_{\slicep} \supset \pS/\Group$. The borders ensure that there is
no more than one group-orbit traversal per chart; a group orbit either
pierces one chart, or no charts at all.

\noindent\textbf{Atlas.}
A set of $(d\!-\!1)$\dmn\ contiguous charts $\pSRed{}^{(1)},
\pSRed{}^{(2)}, \cdots$

\noindent\textbf{\Slice.}
Let $\Group$ act on a $d$-dimensional manifold $\pS$ with its group
orbits of dimension $N$ or less. A \emph{slice} to be a $(d\!-\!N)$
dimensional submanifold $\pSRed$ such that all group orbits that
intersect $\pSRed$ do so transversally and only once.

In literature\rf{Mostow57,Pal61,GuiSte90} `slice' refers to any
co-dimension~$N$ manifold that slices transversally, and only once, all
group orbits in an open neighborhood. Here we have defined a {\slice}
constructively but more narrowly, as a contiguous set of hyperplane
charts, with every group orbit accounted for by the atlas sliced only
once, and belonging to a single chart.

Now that the group orbits have been reduced to points, erase them and
consider the two slices through the two {\template s}. As these two
{\template s} are the closest points viewed from either group orbit, they
lie in both \slice s. However, the two tangent vectors
$\sliceTan{}{}^{(1)}$ and $\sliceTan{}{}^{(2)}$ have different
orientations, so they define two distinct \slice\ hyperplanes
$\pSRed{}^{(1)}$ and $\pSRed{}^{(2)}$ which intersect in the
\emph{ridge}, a hyperplane of dimension $(d\!-\!2)$ (here drawn as a
`line,' and in \reffig{fig:A29-1ridge} as intersection of two `volumes')
shared by the template pair that satisfies both \slice\ conditions
\refeq{ridge}. The chart for the neighborhood of each template (a page of
the atlas in part (d)) extends only as far as this ridge. If the
templates are sufficiently close, the {\chartBord} of each \slice\ (red
region) is beyond this ridge, and not encountered by the symmetry-reduced
trajectory $\sspRed(\zeit)$. The reduced trajectory is continuous in the
slice comprised of such charts - it switches the chart whenever it
crosses a ridge.

The slice (unique point for each group orbit) is now covered by an atlas
consisting of $(d\!-\!1)$\dmn\ charts $\pSRed{}^{(1)}, \pSRed{}^{(2)},

The rest is geometry of hyperplanes, nothing to do with dynamics, only
with the group theory. The \slice, \chartBord\ and ridge conditions
\refeq{PCsectQ0}, \refeq{eq:chartBord} and \refeq{ridge} are all linear
conditions which depend on the ray defined by the \template\ \slicep, not
its magnitude. Checking whether the {\chartBord} is on the far side of
the ridge between two \slice s is a linear computation; for a
symmetry-reduced trajectory moving in $\pSRed{}^{(1)}$ slice one only has
to keep checking the sign of
\beq
\braket{\sspRed(\zeit)}{\sliceTan{}{}^{(2)}}
\,.
\ee{eq:chartBord}
Once this changes the sign, the ridge has been crossed, and from then on
the trajectory should be reduced to the $\pSRed{}^{(2)}$ slice.

Group orbits $\pS_{\slicep}$, group tangents $\groupTan(\slicep)$ and the
associated \slice s are purely group-theoretic, linear concepts: they
know nothing about dynamics. Dynamics enters only through informed
choices of \template s.

The physical task is to, for a given dynamical flow, pick a set of
qualitatively distinct {\template s} (for example, for a turbulent pipe
flow, one typical of 2-roll states, one for 4-roll states, and so on)
whose \slice s  are locally transverse to open sets of nearby orbits, and
which together provide a good atlas for the region of $\pS/\Group$
explored by chaotic trajectories. Each chart $\pS{}^{(j)}$ covers a
neighborhood of an important, qualitatively distinct class of solutions,
of features qualitatively captured by \template\ $\slicep{}^{(j)}$.
Together they provide an atlas -a finite set of hyperplane tiles-
charting the regions of the curved manifold explored by the trajectories
of interest.

{\bf What it is not}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item reduced-dimensionality model: Symmetry reduction is not a
          dimensional-reduction scheme, or flow modeling by fewer degrees
          of freedom: it is a local change of coordinate, with one (or
          $N$) coordinates pointing along the phase directions. The
          $(d\!-\!N)$\dmn\ \reducedsp\ is also $\infty$-dimensional and
          no information is lost, one can go freely between solutions in
          the full and reduced \statesp s by integrating the associated
          {reconstruction equations} \refeq{reconstrEq}.
      \item an atlas is \emph{not needed} for Newton determination of a
            single trajectory; any local section and slice plus time and shift
            constraints is OK, can even move them with each Newton
            iteration. 60,000 \rpo s can be computed\rf{SCD07} this way.
            The question is: what then? and for that you need a good atlas.

literature on symmetry reduction is vast.

{\bf A co-moving frame}
Visualizing a single `relative' trajectory in its co-moving frame, moving with
the mean {\phaseVel} of a given solution, is useful if we are
concerned with that individual solution.
    \PC{cite Golubitsky}
A co-moving frame is useless if
we are concerned with studying collections of these trajectories, as each
solution travels with its own mean {\phaseVel}, and there is no single
co-moving frame that can simultaneously reduce \emph{all} traveling
solutions.

disparage co-moving frames: they are misleading for \rpo s, as they
    misrepresent time segments for which a \po\ might be glued to
    barely unstable \eqv. A co-moving frame rotates with the constant
    mean
    $\timeAver{\velRel}= \shift_p/\period{p}
    \,.
    $ We \emph{emphatically} do not work in
    co-moving frames.

unhappy about ``moving frames'': misleading, as slice is
     \emph{emphatically} stationary. ''Covariant frames'' move, but we
     do not know how to use them

    %\PC{2012-04-12 - reuse this?: ``

    solutions for a given turbulent flow, and we are commencing an exploration of
    states of turbulent fluids in terms of the unstable \po\ solutions whose
    number, as a function of the increasing period, is growing exponentially.
    How are we to visualize \emph{the totality} of these solutions in one go?

{\bf Hilbert bases}

%    \DB{2012-04-10}
%    {A book report on Hilbert bases by Daniel Borrero}
One approach to symmetry reduction that is often used for low-dimensional
dynamical systems is to rewrite the dynamics in terms of a Hilbert
invariant polynomial basis (see \refref{GL-Gil07b} for a clear and
detailed discussion of this method). The idea here is that one can take
the dynamics in equivariant state space coordinates
$(x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_d)$ and rewrite them in terms of polynomials of these
variables $(u_1,u_2,u_3,...,u_m)$ that are invariant under the group
action. The algebra required is quite involved and the required
computations become very large for problems with as few as ten
dimensions\rf{gatermannHab}. This makes the method of Hilbert bases
unfeasible for dealing with high-dimensional dynamical systems, such
as turbulent fluid flows.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{s:concl}

As a turbulent flow evolves, every so often we catch a glimpse of a
familiar structure. For any finite spatial resolution, the flow follows
for a finite time an unstable {\cohStr} belonging to an alphabet of
representative states, here called `\template s'. However, in presence of
symmetries, near recurrences can be identified only if shifted both in
time and space.

In the method of sections (along time direction) and slices (along
spatial symmetry directions) the identification of physically close
states is achieved by cutting the group orbits with a finite set of
hyperplanes, one for each continuous parameter, with each time trajectory
and group orbit of symmetry-equivalent points represented by a single
point, its  section and \slice.
The \mslices\ is akin to (but distinct from) cutting across trajectories
by means of sections. Both methods reduce continuous symmetries: one
sections the continuous-time trajectories, the other slices the layers of
the onion formed by group-orbits. Both are triggered by kin
conditions: oriented piercing of the section, oriented piercing of the slice. Just
as a \PoincSec\ goes bad, the slice goes bad the moment transversality is
lost. \Slice, however, is emphatically \emph{not} a \PoincSec; it
replaces a trajectory by a symmetry-reduced trajectory, whereas a
\PoincSec\ replaces a continuous time trajectory by a sequence of points.

%    \PC{2011-10-18 incorporate this paragraph:
Note also that symmetry reduction is not a dimensional-reduction scheme,
or flow modeling by fewer degrees of freedom: the \reducedsp\ retains the
full dimensionality of the original dynamical systems. No information is
lost, one can go freely between solutions in the full and reduced
\statesp s by integrating the associated {reconstruction equations}.

The main lesson of the visual tour undertaken above is that if a
dynamical problem has a continuous symmetry, the symmetry \emph{must} be
reduced before any detailed analysis of flow's \statesp\ geometry can
take place. So far, this has only been achieved for transitionally
turbulent numerical pipe flows\rf{ACHKW11}, resulting in the discovery of
the first \rpo s embedded in turbulence. In future it should be the first
step in analysis of any turbulent data, numerical\rf{CvGr12} or
experimental\rf{BCS12}. Once symmetry reduction is achieved, all
solutions of a turbulent flow can be plotted together, as one happy
family: all symmetry-equivalent states are represented by a single point,
families of solutions are mapped to a single solution, \reqva\ become
\eqva, \rpo s become \po s, and the global dynamical systems analysis if
terms of invariant solutions and their stable / unstable manifolds can
now commence.
