\begin{abstract}
Symmetry reduction by the method of slices quotients the continuous
symmetries of chaotic flows by replacing the original state space by a
set of charts, each covering a neighborhood of an important,
qualitatively distinct class of solutions, qualitatively captured by a
`template'. Together these charts provide an atlas of slices -a finite
set of hyperplane tiles- charting the regions of the curved manifold
explored by the trajectories of interest. Within the slice, relative
equilibria reduce to equilibria, and relative periodic orbits reduce to
periodic orbits. Visualizations of these solutions and their unstable
manifolds reveal their interrelations and the role they play in
organizing turbulence / chaos.

Today it is possible to take a stroll through 61,506\dmn\ \statesp\ of
hydrodynamic turbulence. Charting this world is a geometer's task, and we
will map it using a measuring tape, but first one has to deal with
symmetries. Physicists have come to love them inordinately, but Nature
less so: even though the governing equations are symmetric, turbulence
breaks all symmetries, and rather than simplifying our task, for
nonlinear systems symmetries obscure the essential dynamics. Evolution
in time decomposes the \statesp\ into a spaghetti of time trajectories,
continuous spatial symmetries stratify it into layers of an onion. There
exist many excellent methods that quotient out symmetries of
low-dimensional systems, but so far only one, \mslices, has proven practical for
for the extremely high-dimensional flows of turbulent fields. In this
geometrical tour of dynamics we cut this knot and pick a
single point for each trajectory (section it) and each group orbit (slice
it). Once the fog of symmetries is out of the way, one can identify and
describe the prominent fluid structures by a taxonomy of its invariant
building blocks: numerically exact solutions of \NSe, finite sets of
\reqva\ and infinite hierarchies of \rpo s, and describe the dynamics in
terms of their heteroclinic connections.

\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

Over the last decade, new insights into the dynamics of moderate
\Reynolds\ turbulent flows have been gained through visualizations of
their $\infty$-dimensional \statesp s by means of dynamically invariant,
representation independent coordinate frames\rf{GHCW07} constructed from
physically prominent unstable {\cohStr s}, hereafter referred to as {\em
\template s}.
The most recent advance within this new framework is
the first determination of \rpo s that in part shape turbulence observed
in pipe flows\rf{ACHKW11}. Navigating and charting the geometry of these
extremely high-dimensional \statesp s necessitates a reexamination of two
of the basic tools of the theory of dynamical systems: \PoincSec s and symmetry
reduction\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000,BeTh04,SiCvi10,FrCv11}. We strive
here to explain the key geometrical ideas in simple but illustrative
settings, eschewing the fluid dynamical and group theoretical
technicalities.

A flow $\map^t$ and the \statesp\ $\pS$ on which the flow acts comprise a
{dynamical system}. If a group $\Group$ of continuous transformations
acts on a continuous time flow, each \statesp\ point owns a set of
tangent vectors (\reffig{fig:A27wurst}\,(a)). Integrated globally, the
velocity vector $\vel(\ssp)$ traces out the {\em trajectory}
$\flow{\zeit}{\ssp}$ ( \reffig{fig:A27wurst}\,(b)). Applying the continuous
transformations traces out the {group orbit} (or, from now on, just
\emph{orbit})
\(
\pS_\ssp = \{\LieEl\,\ssp \mid \LieEl \in {\Group}\}
% \,,\qquad \pS_\ssp \subset \pS
\,
\) %ee{sspOrbit}
(\reffig{fig:A27wurst}\,(c)). Together they trace out a complicated smooth
manifold (hereafter affectionately referred to as the {\em wurst}, see
figures~\ref{fig:A27wurst}\,(d), \ref{fig:CLf01group}\,(b) and
\ref{fig:sliceimage}), that we shall teach you here how to slice.

A flow is said to have symmetry $\Group$ if the form of evolution
equations $\dot{\ssp} = \vel(\ssp)$ is left invariant,
\(
\vel(\ssp)=\LieEl^{-1} \, \vel(\LieEl \, \ssp)
% \,,\qquad \mbox{for all }
\,,
\) %ee{eq:FiniteRot}
by the set of transformations $\LieEl \in {\Group}$. Physicists love
symmetry, but Nature does not care: turbulence breaks all symmetries,
and while the flow equations may be invariant under $\Group$, their
solutions typically are not.

Despite this inconvenience, we can make way in unraveling the spaghetti
of 1\dmn\ trajectories with the notion of recurrence. To quantify how
close the state of the system at its present state is to a previously
visited state we need the notion of distance between two points in
\statesp. The simplest (but far from the only, or the most natural) is
the Euclidean norm
\beq
  \Norm{\ssp-\ssp'}^2  = \braket{\ssp-\ssp'}{\ssp-\ssp'} =
\sum_j^d
(\ssp-\ssp')_j^2
\,.
\ee{innerproduct}
Given a notion of distance we can talk about a 'neighborhood,' the open
set of nearby states. Our main task in what follows will be to make this
precise by defining a chart over a neighborhood and its borders. Given
distances and neighborhoods, the next key notion is  \emph{measure}, or
how likely a typical trajectory is to visit a given neighborhood. After
some observations of a given turbulent flow, one can identify a set of
representative \emph{\template s}\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000},
{points} $\slicep{}^{(j)}$, $j=1,2,\cdots$ in the \statesp\ $\pS$, which
are the dynamically most important unstable {\recurrStr s} of the flow.

Our goals here are two-fold:
(i) In \refsect{s:cut} we review the method of \PoincSec s, with
    emphasis on aspects applicable to high-dimensional flows:
    construction of multiple local linear `charts' and determination of
    their borders followed by a brief study of continuous symmetries in
    \refsect{s:symm}.
(ii) In \refsect{s:slice} we show how the same set of tools applied to
    reduction of continuous symmetries enables us to commence a
    systematic charting of the long-time dynamics of high-dimensional
    flows with continuous symmetries (\refsect{s:chart}).


\section{Section}
\label{s:cut}

In the {\em \PoincSec} method, one records the coordinates
$\sspRed_n$ of the trajectory $\ssp(\zeit)$ at the instants $\zeit_n$
when it traverses a fixed oriented hypersurface $\PoincS$ of codimension
1. For high-dimensional flows that we have in mind the practical choice
is a hyperplane, the only type of \PoincSec\ (from now on, just a
\emph{section}) we shall consider here. Such a section captures
important features of the flow in an open neighborhood of the
section-fixing \template.

A well chosen section captures the dynamics in the neighborhood of its
\template, but how far does this neighborhood extend? The answer is that
the section captures neighboring trajectories as long as it cuts them
transversally; it fails the moment the velocity field at a point
$\sspRSing$ fails to pierce the section. At these locations, the velocity
either vanishes (\eqv) or is orthogonal to the section normal $\hat{n}$,
\beq
    \hat{n} \cdot \vel(\sspRSing) = 0
\,,\qquad
    \sspRSing \in \cal{S}
\,.
\ee{eq:sspRSing}
For a smooth flow such points form a smooth $(d\!-\!2)$\dmn\
\emph{\poincBord} ${\cal S} \subset \PoincS$, which encloses the open
neighborhood of the {\template} characterized by qualitatively similar
flow. We shall refer to this region of the section as a `chart' of the
{\template} neighborhood (see \reffig{fig:RoessTrjs}\,(b) and
\reffig{fig:RoessFarEq}). Beyond the border, the flow pierces the section
hyperplane in the `wrong' direction and the dynamics are qualitatively
different.

As an example consider the system of R\"ossler\rf{ross},
\index{R\"ossler system}
\beq
\begin{split}
  \dot{x} &= -y \,-\,z \\
  \dot{y} &= x + a y \\
  \dot{z} &= b + z (x - c)
  \,,
  \label{eq:Rossler}
\end{split}
\eeq
where $a = b = 0.2$ and $c = 5.7$. This flow has two prominent invariant
states, the `inner' and the `outer' unstable \eqva\ $\slicep{}^{(-)}$
and $\slicep{}^{(+)}$, which we pick as {\em \template s}
(\refFig{fig:RoessTrjs}) for our sections.

We orient the sections so the plane $\PoincS_{-}$ contains the 1\dmn\
stable eigenvector of $\slicep{}^{(-)}$ (\reffig{fig:RoessTrjs}\,(b)),
and the other section $\PoincS_{+}$ contains the 1\dmn\ unstable
eigenvector of $\slicep{}^{(+)}$ (\reffig{fig:RoessFarEq}\,(a)), thus
capturing the local spiral-in, spiral-out dynamics. The remaining freedom
to rotate each section can be used to orient them in such a way that the
ridge (the intersection of the two sections) lies approximately
between the two templates (\reffig{fig:RoessFarEq}\,(b)). Such a choice
guarantees that both neighborhoods will be well represented.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For R\"ossler flow, the border condition \refeq{eq:sspRSing} yields a
quadratic condition in 3 dimensions, so \poincBord s\ drawn in
\reffig{fig:RoessTrjs}\,(b) and \reffig{fig:RoessFarEq} are conic
sections. The two charts meet at a ridge, and together do a pretty good
job as the 2-chart atlas of the interesting R\"ossler dynamics. As
explained in ChaosBook.org\rf{DasBuch}, due to extreme contraction rate,
the section in \reffig{fig:RoessTrjs}\,(b) is for all practical purposes
1\dmn, and the associated return map yields all \po s of the 3\dmn\ flow.

In 3 dimensions everything -sections, ridges, \poincBord s- can be
drawn, and a $\chi\alpha\rho\tau\eta\varsigma$ does fit on a sheet of
papyrus. But what about high-dimensional flows? The point of the
cartography enterprize undertaken here is that while it is impossible to
visualize the 61,504% 61,506-2 $(d\!-\!2)$
\dmn\ {\poincBord} of the 61,505% 61,506-1 $(d\!-\!1)$
\dmn\ slab that is now our chart\rf{GibsonMovies}, a point is a point,
and a line is a line in a projection from any number of dimensions, so a
trajectory crossing of both a section and a {\poincBord} can be easily
determined and visualized in any dimension.

To summarize:
Evolution in time decomposes the \statesp\ into a spaghetti of 1\dmn\
trajectories $\ssp(\zeit)$, each determined by a single point $\ssp(0)$
on it. A well chosen set of \emph{sections} of codimension 1 allows us to
`quotient' the continuous time parameter $\zeit$. For unstable
trajectories one needs, in addition, a notion of recurrence to the
section. The set of points $\{\sspRed_n\} = \{\ssp(\zeit_n)\}$,  separated
by short-time section to section flights, then captures the transverse
dynamics without losing any information about the chaotic flow.
We can thus chart the regions of \statesp\ of interest, by a picking a
sufficient number of \template s and the associated charts over their
neighborhoods, each bounded by \poincBord s and ridges.

Two concluding remarks on what sections \emph{are not}:

(1) A \PoincSec\ is {\em not} a projection onto a
lower-dimensional space: Rather, it is a local change of coordinates to a
direction along the flow $\vel(\sspRed)$, and the remaining coordinates
transverse to it. No information about the flow is lost; the full space
trajectory can always be reconstructed by integration from its point
$\sspRed$ in the section.

(2) The method of \PoincSec s is {\em not} equivalent to
\emph{strobing} a flow at a sequence of instants in time. While
`strobing' is what any numerical integrator does, by representing a
trajectory by a sequence of time-integration step separated points, this
is no reduction of a flow to a codimension 1 manifold, as the sequence of
strobed points still resides in the full \statesp\ $\pS$ of
dimensionality $d$.

What is a symmetry? A visualization of the fluid dynamics of a pipe flow,
\reffig{fig:A27-pipeSymms}, affords an intuitive illustration. Solutions
of pipe flow remain physically the same under azimuthal rotations and
stream-wise translations (which become \SOn{2} rotations in numerical
stream-wise periodic pipes) but correspond to different points in
\statesp\ and may look very different in its visualizations.

Each \SOn{2} group orbit is topologically a circle, but it traces out a
complicated \statesp\ curve composed of many Fourier modes nonlinearly
coupled and thus of comparable magnitudes. Together
the two \SOn{2} sweep out contorted and hard to visualize $T^2$ tori (see
\refref{ACHKW11}), but we shall illustrate here the key ideas by a much
simpler example, the $\SOn{2}$-equivariant Gibbon and
McGuinness\rf{GibMcCLE82,FowlerCLE82} \cLe\ of geophysics and laser
physics,
\bea
	\dot{x}_1 &=& -\sigma x_1 + \sigma y_1
        \,,\qquad
	\dot{x}_2 \,=\, -\sigma x_2 + \sigma y_2
        \continue
	\dot{y}_1 &=& (\RerCLor-z) x_1 - \ImrCLor x_2 -y_1-e y_2 \continue
	\dot{y}_2 &=& \ImrCLor x_1 + (\RerCLor-z) x_2 + e y_1- y_2\continue
	\dot{z} \; &=& -b z + x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2

Here the parameters are set to Siminos's values $\RerCLor=28,\,
\ImrCLor=0,\, b=8/3,\, \sigma=10,\, e= 1/10$. (For the background and an

The strange attractor of the \cLf\ \reffig{fig:CLf01group}\,(a), in its
present state, is a complete mess. Without a proper account of the
symmetries at hand we merely observe the flow settling into motions with
low friction. Since motion along the non-shape-changing symmetry
directions is energetically cheap, solutions tend to drift along rather
than dance to distant neighborhoods, with the physically important
shape-changing dynamics hidden from view. Yet embedded within this
strange attractor lies a multitude of dynamically important trajectories.

Here is the ultimate drifter, a signature invariant solution that signals
presence of a continuous symmetry: A {\em \reqv} (traveling wave,
rotational wave, ...) is a trajectory whose velocity field lies within
the group tangent space, such that
\(
\vel(\ssp) = c \cdot \groupTan(\ssp)
\) %\label{phaseVel}
with a constant {\phaseVel} $c$, and whose time evolution is thus
confined to the group orbit; think of an unchanging body carried by a
stream.

A {\em \rpo} behaves more like a dancer. $\pS_p$ is a trajectory which
exactly recurs
\beq
\ssp(\zeit) = \LieEl_p \, \ssp(\zeit + \period{p} )
    \,,\qquad
\ssp(\zeit) \in \pS_p
\ee{RPOrelper1}
after a fixed {relative period} $\period{p}$, but shifted by a fixed
group action ${\LieEl}$ that maps the endpoint $\ssp (\period{p}) $ back
into the initial point cycle point $\ssp (0) $; think of a dancer moving
across the stage through a set of motions and then striking the initial
pose\rf{ShWi06}, or study the pipe flow sketches \reffig{fig:A27-pipeSymms}.

As the $\SOn{2}$ transformations act on the \cLf\ only through the
simplest, $m=1$ Fourier mode, here all group orbits are circles, and appear
elliptical in most $d=5 \to 3$~dimensions projections. Nevertheless, even
the wurst traced out by the very simplest, short \rpo\ $\cycle{01}$ shown
in \reffig{fig:CLf01group}\,(b) is not so easy to get one's head around:
you are looking at a 3\dmn\ projection of a \emph{torus} embedded in 5
dimensions.

To summarize: continuous symmetries of dynamics stratify the \statesp\
into an onion, each layer a group orbit (\reffig{fig:BeThMovFr}). We are
free to replace a given flow $\ssp(\zeit)$ by another, physically
equivalent flow $\ssp(\zeit)=\LieEl(\zeit)\,\sspRed(\zeit)$ by any, in
general, time dependent {\em moving
frame}\rf{FelsOlver98,FelsOlver99,OlverInv} transformation
$\LieEl(\zeit)$. For example, to film our dancer we can mount the camera
on a cart moving alongside her. So, in the presence of continuous symmetries,
there are two kinds of changes in time: a dancer, continuously changing
shapes, or a drifter, merely shuffling along the easy, shape invariant directions. We will presently banish the drifters, and just enjoy the
dance.

$\sspSing$ normal to \refeq{sliceSingl0}, the quadratic Casimir-weighted

$(d\!-\!2)$\dmn\ {\em \chartBord} hyperplane $\sspRSing \in {\cal S}$, within
which all group tangents $\groupTan(\sspRSing)$ lie in the \slice\ hyperplane and are
thus normal to $\sliceTan{}$. Beyond this boundary, the group orbits
pierce the \slice\ hyperplane in the wrong direction, so only the
half-hyperplane that contains the \template\ belongs to the slice. The
{\chartBord} is not easy to visualize; For the lack of dimensions, here
it is drawn here as a `line,' the $z$ axis in this 3\dmn\ sketch. (a) If
the equivariant coordinates transform only under the $m=1$ representation
of $\SOn{2}$, every group orbit is a circle, and crosses any
hyperplane twice. However, if there are coordinates that transform as
higher $m$, group orbit can pierce the hyperplane up to $2m$ times, and
the {\chartBord} lies closer to the template. (b) For example, a group
orbit for a combination of $m=1$ and $m=2$ equivariant coordinates
resembles a baseball seam, and can be sliced 4 times, out of which only
the point closest to the \template\ is in the slice (from \wwwcb{}).

Suppose your day job is computing invariant solutions of \NSe. Do you
really want to compute the same solution over and over again, for every
point on the group orbit? No, you would like to compute it only once. The
strategy for picking out that one solution is called \emph{symmetry
reduction}. Its goal is to replace each group orbit by a unique point in
a lower-dimensional symmetry-\reducedsp\ $\pSRed \subset \pS/\Group$, as
sketched in \reffig{fig:BeThTraj}.

What is a smart way to go about it? Intuition gained from pipe flow (see
\reffig{fig:A27-pipeSymms}), will again prove helpful. A turbulent flow
exhibits a myriad of unstable structures, all traveling down the pipe,
each with its own {\phaseVel}. The
\mslices\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000,BeTh04,SiCvi10,FrCv11} that we now
describe tells you how to pull each solution back into a {\em fixed}
frame, the \slice, and compare it to your repertoire of precomputed
solutions, the \template s $\{\slicep{}^{(j)}\}$, using the
principle of the closest distance to each. What follows is very much like
the construction of sections of \refsect{s:cut}; due to the linear action
of the symmetry group, slicing is easier than sectioning, but is wholly
unfamiliar - that is why we warmed up by reviewing the \PoincSec s. We
now offer a pictorial tour of this, save for the one bold
incursion\rf{ACHKW11}, hitherto unchartered territory.

First, pick a \template\ $\slicep$ and use the freedom to choose a
moving frame (\reffig{fig:BeThMovFr}\,(b)) to shift and rotate $\slicep$
until it overlies, as well as possible, the state $\ssp$, by minimizing
the distance
\beq
\Norm{\ssp - \LieEl(\gSpace)\,\slicep}
\, .
\ee{minDistance}
The entire group orbit of $\ssp$ is then replaced by the closest match to
the template pattern, given by $\sspRed=\LieEl^{-1}\ssp$. The
symmetry-\reducedsp\ $\pSRed$ is comprised of such closest matches
$\sspRed$, a point for each full \statesp\ group orbit; the hat on
$\sspRed$ indicates the unique point on the group orbit of $\ssp$ closest
to the \template\ \slicep.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


The minimal distance satisfies
the extremum condition (\reffig{fig:A28extremum})
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial \gSpace} \Norm{\ssp - \LieEl(\gSpace)\,\slicep}^2
   =
2\, \braket{\sspRed - \slicep}{\sliceTan{}}
   = 0
        \,,\quad
\sliceTan{} = \Lg \slicep
\,,
\]
where the $[d\!\times\!d]$ matrix $\Lg$ is the generator of infinitesimal
symmetry transformations. $\Norm{\LieEl(\gSpace)\slicep}$ is a constant,
the group tangent vector $\sliceTan{}$ evaluated at $\slicep$
is normal to $\slicep$, and the term
$\braket{\slicep}{\Lg \,\slicep}$ vanishes ($\Lg$ is antisymmetric).
Therefore  $\sspRed$, the point on the group orbit of $\ssp$ that lands
in the \slice satisfies the \emph{\slice\ condition}
\beq
\braket{\sspRed}{\sliceTan{}} = 0
    \,.
\ee{PCsectQ0}
This defines a $(d\!-\!N)$\dmn\ hyperplane normal to
the $N$ group tangents evaluated at the \slicep, sketched in
\reffig{fig:slice}, in a highly idealized manner: A group orbit is a
$N$\dmn\ manifold and even for $\SOn{2}$ it is usually only topologically
a circle, and can intersect a hyperplane any number of times  (see
\reffigs{fig:sliceimage}{fig:chartBord}).

The \mslices, a \statesp\ visualization:
(a)
Chart $\pSRed \subset \pS/\Group$ lies in the $(d\!-\!N)$\dmn\
hyperplane \refeq{PCsectQ0} normal to $\sliceTan{j}$, which
span the $N$\dmn\ space tangent to the group orbit $\LieEl\,\slicep$
(dotted line) evaluated at the {\template} point $\slicep$. The
hyperplane intersects {all} full \statesp\ group orbits (green
dashes).  The full \statesp\
trajectory $\ssp(\zeit)$ (blue) and the \reducedsp\ trajectory
$\sspRed(\zeit)$ (green) are equivalent up to a `moving frame' rotation
$\ssp(\zeit)=\LieEl(\zeit)\,\sspRed(\zeit)$, where $\LieEl(\zeit)$ is a
shorthand for $\LieEl(\gSpace(\zeit))$.
(b)
In the full \statesp\ a \rpo\ $\ssp(0) \to \ssp(\zeit) \to
\ssp(\period{})$ returns to the group orbit of $\ssp(0)$ after time
$\period{}$ and a rotation by $\LieEl$,  $\ssp(0)=\LieEl \, \ssp
(\period{})$. A generic \rpo\ quasi-\-periodically fills out what is
topologically a torus (\reffig{fig:CLf01group}\,(b)). In the \slice\
the symmetry-reduced trajectory is periodic, $\sspRed(0) =
\sspRed(\period{})$.
 }\label{fig:slice}
 \end{figure}

As $\ssp$ varies in time, the {\template} $\slicep$ tracks the motion
using the \slice\ condition \refeq{PCsectQ0} to minimize
$\Norm{\ssp(\zeit)-\LieEl(\phi(\zeit))\slicep}$, and the full-space
trajectory $\ssp(\zeit)$ is thus rotated into the {\reducedsp} $\pSRed$
by appropriate time varying \emph{moving frame} angles
$\{\gSpace(\zeit)\}$, as depicted in \reffig{fig:slice}\,{(a)}. One can
write the equations for the flow in the \reducedsp\, $\dot{\sspRed} =
\velRed(\sspRed)$, which confine the motion to the \slice\ hyperplane,
$\sspRed(\zeit) \in \pSRed$, as
\bea
\velRed(\sspRed) &=& \vel(\sspRed)
     \,-\, \dot{\gSpace}(\sspRed) \, \groupTan(\sspRed)
\label{EqMotMFrame}\\
\dot{\gSpace}(\sspRed) &=& \braket{\vel(\sspRed)}{\sliceTan{}}
                       /\braket{\groupTan(\sspRed)}{\sliceTan{}}
\,.
\label{reconstrEq}
\eea
Thus the dynamical system $\{\pS,\map^t\}$ with continuous symmetry
\Group\ is replaced by the {\reducedsp} dynamics $\{\pSRed,\mapRed^t\}$:
with the velocity in the full \statesp\ $\vel$ the sum of $\velRed$, the
velocity component in the \slice\ hyperplane, and $\dot{\gSpace}\,\groupTan$, the
velocity component along the group tangent space. The integral of the
{\em reconstruction equation} $\dot{\gSpace}$ keeps track of the group
shift in the full \statesp.

      satisfying the \slice\ condition \refeq{PCsectQ0}. An $\SOn{2}$ \rpo\
      is topologically a torus, so the two cuts are the two \po\ images

The {\template} $\slicep$ should be a generic \statesp\ point in the
sense that its group orbit has the full $N$ dimensions of the group
\Group. The set of the group orbit points \emph{closest} to the
\template\ \slicep\ forms a neighborhood of \slicep\ in which each group
orbit intersects the hyperplane \emph{only once}. A \slice\ hyperplane
captures neighboring group orbits until, for a point $\sspRSing$ not so
close to the \template, the group tangent vector $t(\hat{x}')$ lies in the \slice\ hyperplane. The
group orbits for such points are grazed tangentially rather than sliced
transversally, much like what happens at the \poincBord\
\refeq{eq:sspRSing} for evolution in time. This is also a linear
condition, and it defines the {\sliceBord} ${\cal S}$, a hyperplane in
which both points $\sspRSing$ and their group tangents
$\groupTan(\sspRSing)$ lie in the \slice\ hyperplane,\rf{FrCv11}
\beq
\braket{\sspRSing}{\sliceTan{}} \,=\, 0
      \mbox{ and }
\braket{\groupTan(\sspRSing)}{\sliceTan{}} \,=\, 0
\,.
\label{sliceSingl0}
\eeq
There is yet another, much preferable kind of border: a ridge.
Our initial chart $\pSRed{}^{(1)}$ is a ($d\!-\!1$)\dmn\
hyperplane. If we pick another {\template} point $\slicep{}^{(2)}$, it
comes along with its own \slice\ hyperplane $\pSRed{}^{(2)}$. Any pair of
$(d\!-\!1)$\dmn\ local \slice\ hyperplanes intersects in a \emph{ridge},
a $(d\!-\!2)$\dmn\ hyperplane {\PoincS} (drawn in
\reffig{fig:A29-2slices}\,({\it c}) as a `line' and in
\reffig{fig:A29-1ridge} as a `plane' of intersection of two volumes)
shared by a pair of charts and thus satisfies both \slice\ conditions
\refeq{PCsectQ0},
\beq
\braket{\sspRed^*}{\sliceTan{}{}^{(1)}} = 0
\mbox{ and }
\braket{\sspRed^*}{\sliceTan{}{}^{(2)}} = 0
    \,.
\ee{ridge}
We shall refer to the neighborhood of a \template\ \slicep\ bounded by
its {\chartBord} and the ridges to other such linear neighborhoods as a
\emph{chart} $\pSRed{}^{({\slicep})} \subset \pS/\Group$, and to
\refeq{sliceSingl0} and \refeq{ridge} as the \emph{border conditions}.

\section{Charting the \slice}
\label{s:chart}

Let us summarize the voyage so far: We are charting a curved manifold,
and it would be nice to use tools of differential geometry, but try it in
61,506~dimensions. The only feasible way to chart this space is to (1)
quotient all continuous symmetries, and (2) tile it with
$(61,506-N-1)$\dmn\ tiles, or `charts'. We do it in steps, starting
locally, with a set of \template s, and building up the goal of the whole
construction, the \slice\ which captures all of the reduced dynamics of
interest.

\begin{description}

\item[\Template]
Pick a {\template} $\slicep$ such that $\Group$ acts on it
regularly with a group orbit of dimension $N$.

\item[\Slice\ hyperplane]
The $(d\!-\!N)$-dimensional hyperplane satisfying
\( %beq
\braket{\sspRed}{\sliceTan{a}}=0
\,,
\) %\ee{PCsectQ1}
normal to group transformation directions at the {\template} $\slicep$.
\index{slice}

\item[Moving frame]
For any $\ssp$, the \slice\ condition $\braket{\sspRed}{\sliceTan{}}=0$
on $\ssp = \LieEl(\gSpace)\sspRed$ determines the moving frame, \ie, the
group action $\LieEl(\gSpace)$ that brings $ \ssp$ into the \slice\
hyperplane.
\index{moving frame}

\item[\ChartBord]
The set of points in \slice\ hyperplane whose group orbits are grazed
tangentially, with both points $\sspRSing$ and their group tangents
$\groupTan(\sspRSing)$  in the \slice\ hyperplane,
$\braket{\sspRSing}{\sliceTan{}} \,=\,
\braket{\groupTan(\sspRSing)}{\sliceTan{}} \,=\, 0 \,.$

\item[Ridge]
A hyperplane of points $\sspRed^* \in \PoincS{}^{(21)}$ formed by the
intersection of a pair of \slice\ hyperplanes $\pSRed{}^{(1)}$ and
$\pSRed{}^{(2)}$,
\(
\braket{\sspRed^*}{\sliceTan{}{}^{(1)}} =
\braket{\sspRed^*}{\sliceTan{}{}^{(2)}} = 0
    \,.
\) %ee{ridge}
Ridge is a \PoincSec\ $\PoincS{}^{(ij)}$ that serves as a toll bridge,
crossed by any transit from a chart $\pSRed{}^{(j)}$ to an adjacent chart
$\pSRed{}^{(i)}$.

\item[Chart]
The neighborhood of a \template\ $\slicep{}^{(j)}$, bounded by the
{\chartBord} and the ridges to other linear neighborhoods, comprises
a \emph{chart} $\pSRed{}^{(j)} \subset \pS/\Group$. The borders ensure
that there is no more than one oriented group-orbit traversal per chart;
a group orbit either pierces one chart, or no charts at all.

\item[Atlas]
A set of $(d\!-\!N)$\dmn\ contiguous charts $\pSRed{}^{(1)},
\pSRed{}^{(2)}, \cdots$

\item[\Slice]
Let $\Group$ act on a $d$-dimensional manifold $\pS$, with group
orbits of dimension $N$ or less. A \emph{\slice} is a $(d\!-\!N)$
dimensional submanifold $\pSRed$ such that all group orbits that
intersect $\pSRed$ do so transversally and only once.

\end{description}

In literature\rf{Mostow57,Pal61,GuiSte90} `slice' refers to any
co-dimension~$N$ manifold that slices transversally, and only once, all
group orbits in an open neighborhood. Here we have defined an atlas
constructively but more narrowly, as a contiguous set of hyperplane
charts, with every group orbit accounted for by the atlas sliced only
once, and belonging to a single chart. A \slice\ is not global, it slices
only the group orbits in an open neighborhood of the \statesp\ region of
interest.

The physical task is to, for a given dynamical flow, pick a set of
qualitatively distinct {\template s} (for a turbulent pipe
flow there might be one typical of 2-roll states, one for 4-roll states, and so on)
which together provide a good atlas for the region of $\pS/\Group$
explored by chaotic trajectories.

The rest is geometry of hyperplanes, nothing to do with dynamics. Group
orbits $\pS_{\slicep}$, group tangents $\groupTan(\slicep)$, and the
associated charts are purely group-theoretic, linear concepts. The
\slice, \chartBord\ and ridge conditions \refeq{PCsectQ0},
\refeq{eq:chartBord} and \refeq{ridge} are all linear conditions which
depend on the ray defined by the \template\ \slicep, not its magnitude.
Checking whether the {\chartBord} is on the far side of the ridge between
two \slice\ hyperplanes is a linear computation; for a symmetry-reduced
trajectory moving in $\pSRed{}^{(1)}$ chart one only has to keep checking
the sign of
\beq
\braket{\sspRed(\zeit)}{\sliceTan{}{}^{(2)}}
\,.
\ee{eq:chartBord}
Once the sign changes, the ridge has been crossed, and from then on
the trajectory should be reduced to the $\pSRed{}^{(2)}$ chart.
How this works in practice is illustrated by the 2-chart atlas of
\cLe, see \reffig{fig:cLe-2charts}.

Two concluding remarks on what \slice s \emph{are not}:

(1) Symmetry reduction is not a dimensional-reduction scheme, or a
projection on a fewer coordinates, or flow modeling by fewer degrees of
freedom: It is a local change of coordinate with one (or $N$)
coordinates pointing along the phase directions. No information is lost
by symmetry `reduction', one can go freely between solutions in the full
and reduced \statesp s by integrating the associated {reconstruction
equations} \refeq{reconstrEq}.

(2) An atlas is \emph{not needed} for Newton determination of a single
invariant solution, or a study of its bifurcations.\rf{golubII} Any local
section and slice plus time and shift constraints does the job. 60,000
\rpo s can be computed\rf{SCD07} this way. Once we have more than one
invariant solution, the question is: How is this totality of solutions
interrelated? and for that a good atlas is a necessity.


\section{Bridges to nowhere}
\label{s:bridge}
    % kvetches, still to be written

Everyone encounters a symmetry sooner or later, so literature on symmetry
reduction is vast (for a historical overview, see remarks in
ChaosBook.org and \refref{SiCvi10}) Before asking - why the \mslices\ and
not my [...]? a brief tour of the graveyard of obvious ideas and pet
symmetry reduction schemes is called for. They all have one thing in
common: they do not work.

To start with: if you are a master of quantum-mechanics / QFT and their
irreducible representations,\rf{PCgr} you may leave your baggage at the
door - the way symmetries act on nonlinear systems is much subtler, as we
tried to show in this pictorial tour. The same for masters of
bifurcations\rf{golubII} - linear theory works quite well there.

There are purely group-theoretical approaches, with no dynamics to inform
them. For $\SOn{2}$, the obvious idea is to go to polar coordinates. The
simplest nonlinear examples\rf{AGHO288} already run into $r_j \to 0$ type
of singularities, and it is not altogether clear how one would rewrite
\NSe\ in such a format, or integrate them numerically. For pipe flows, one
would need cylindrical Bessel functions eigenbases, never used in
numerical work. More sophisticated are rewrites of dynamics in terms of
invariant polynomial bases, described clearly for low dimensions in
\refref{GL-Gil07b}, with equivariant \statesp\ coordinates
$(x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_d)$ replaced by invariant polynomial basis
$(u_1,u_2,u_3,...,u_m)$. With the dimension, the number of these
polynomials grows, and so does the number of syzygies, the nonlinear
relations amongst them. There is no guiding principle for picking a set of
such polynomials, and no practical way to implement the
scheme\rf{gatermannHab} for high dimensional flows: how and why would one
go from 61,506 equivariant \statesp\ coordinates to a vast number of
invariant polynomials replaceing them?

There are dynamics informed approaches, foremost among them being the
method of {co-moving frames}. Visualizing a single `relative' trajectory
in its co-moving frame, \ie, moving with the mean {\phaseVel} of a given
solution, is useful if we are concerned with the individual solution and
the tiny \rpo s (modulated-amplitude waves) that have bifurcated off of
it.\rf{duguet08,mellibovsky11} A co-moving frame is useless, however, if
we are concerned with studying collections of these trajectories, as each
solution travels with its own mean {\phaseVel}, and there is no single
co-moving frame that can simultaneously reduce \emph{all} traveling
solutions. The \slice s that we construct here are \emph{emphatically}
stationary.

%{\bf Marsdenmania}

There are sophisticated approaches to reducing symplectic symmetries of
mechanics\rf{MaWe74}, or use Lie symmetry reduction to rederive Eulerian
velocity fields from Lagrangian trajectories\rf{MorrGree80}. Our goal
here is different. Rather than to reduce a particular set of dynamical
equations, we seek to formulate a computationally straightforward and general
method of reducing continuous symmetries, applicable to any
high-dimensional chaotic/turbulent flow. One should also note that
``symmetry reduction'' in general relativity and Lie theory often implies
restriction of solution space to a subspace of higher symmetry; here we
always work in the full \statesp.

There is one intriguing, obvious and physically informed contender,
called ``method of connections'' by
Marsden\rf{Smale70I,AbrMars78,rowley_reduction_2003}, illustrated in
\reffig{fig:BeThMconnect}. It is a group dynamics kin of the strobing
method of \refsect{s:cut}, and it does not reduce the dynamics to a
lower-dimensional \reducedsp\ $\pS/\Group$. However, in field theory the
freedom of choosing moving frames of \reffig{fig:BeThMovFr} is called
``gauge freedom,'' and a particular prescription of choosing a frame is
called ``gauge fixing,'' or a ``gauge.'' The meaning of the ``method of
connections'' is clearest in the work of Shapere and
Wilczek\rf{ShWi89a,ShWi06}: one can observe a swimmer (or our dancer) from
a fixed \slice\ frame, or bring her back to observe only the
shape-changing dynamics, no drifting. Left to herself, she will reemerge
in the same pose someplace else: that shift is called a ``geometrical
phase,'' which -while accruing it is the whole point of swimming- has not
played any role in our symmetry reduction. Conversely, most gauge choices
in quantum field theory are covariant, and while that suffices to
regularize path integrals, the \mslices\ says that is no symmetry
reduction at all and yields no insights into the geometry of nonlinear flows.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{s:concl}

As a turbulent flow evolves, every so often we catch a glimpse of a
familiar structure. For any finite spatial resolution and time, the flow
follows an unstable {\cohStr} belonging to an alphabet of representative
states, here called `\template s'. However, in the presence of
symmetries, near recurrences can be identified only if shifted both in
time and space.

In the method of sections (along time direction) and slices (along
spatial symmetry directions) the identification of physically close
states is achieved by cutting the group orbits with a finite set of
hyperplanes, one for each continuous parameter, with each time trajectory
and group orbit of symmetry-equivalent points represented by a single
point, its  section and \slice. The \mslices\ is akin to (but distinct
from) cutting across trajectories by means of sections. Both methods
reduce continuous symmetries: one sections the continuous-time
trajectories, the other slices the layers of the onion formed by
group-orbits. Both are triggered by kin conditions: oriented piercing of
the section, oriented piercing of the slice. Just as a \PoincSec\ goes
bad, the \slice\ hyperplane goes bad the moment transversality is lost. A
slice, however, is emphatically \emph{not} a \PoincSec. Instead it
replaces a trajectory by a continuous symmetry-reduced trajectory,
whereas a \PoincSec\ replaces a continuous time trajectory by a discrete
sequence of points.

Note also that symmetry reduction is not a dimensional-reduction scheme,
or flow modeling by fewer degrees of freedom: the full dimensionality of
the original dynamical systems is retained. No information is lost, as
one can go freely between solutions in the full and reduced \statesp s by
integrating the associated {reconstruction equation} \refeq{reconstrEq}.

The main lesson of the visual tour undertaken above is that if a
dynamical problem has a continuous symmetry, the symmetry \emph{must} be
reduced before any detailed analysis of the flow's \statesp\ geometry can
take place. So far, this has only been achieved for transitionally
turbulent numerical pipe flows\rf{ACHKW11} resulting in the discovery of
the first \rpo s embedded in turbulence. In the future it should be the first
step in the analysis of any turbulent data, numerical\rf{CvGr12} or
experimental\rf{BCS12}. Once symmetry reduction is achieved, all
solutions of a turbulent flow can be plotted in concert, as one happy
family: all symmetry-equivalent states are represented by a single point,
families of solutions are mapped to a single solution, \reqva\ become
\eqva, \rpo s become \po s, and most importantly, the analysis of the global dynamical system in
terms of invariant solutions and their stable / unstable manifolds can
now commence.
