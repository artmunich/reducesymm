As a turbulent flow evolves, every so often we catch a glimpse of a
familiar structure. For any finite spatial resolution, the flow
follows for a finite time a coherent structure belonging to an
alphabet of admissible fluid states, represented here by a set of \reqv\
and \rpo\ solutions of \NS. These are not the `modes' of the fluid; {they
do not provide a decomposition of the flow into a sum of components at
different wavelengths, or a basis for low-dimensional
modeling.} Each such solution spans the whole range of physical scales of
the turbulent fluid, from the outer wall-to-wall scale, down to the
viscous dissipation scale. Numerical computations require sufficient
resolution to cover all of these scales, so no {global} dimension
reduction is likely. The role of invariant solutions of \NS\ is, instead,
to partition the $\infty$-dimensional \statesp\ into a finite set of
neighborhoods visited by a typical long-time turbulent fluid state.

For pipe flow \reqva\ and \rpo s embody a vision of turbulence as a
repertoire of recurrent spatio-temporal coherent structures explored by
turbulent dynamics. Given a set of invariant solutions, the next
step is to understand how the dynamics interconnects the neighborhoods of
the invariant solutions discovered so far.

Currently, a taxonomy of these myriad states eludes us, but emboldened by
successes in applying periodic orbit theory to the simpler 'Ring of Fire' problem
\rf{Christiansen97,lanCvit07,SCD07}, we are optimistic.

In a co-moving frame, moving with the mean phase velocity of a given
solution, a \rpo\ reduces to a \po.
However, as each solution travels with its own mean downstream velocity,
there is no single co-moving frame that can simultaneously reduce
\emph{all} traveling solutions.
    \PC{disparage co-moving frames: they are misleading for \rpo s, as they
    misrepresent time segments for which a \po\ might be glued to
    barely unstable \eqv. A co-moving frame rotates with the constant
    mean
    $\timeAver{\velRel}= \shift_p/\period{p}
    \,.
    $ We \emph{emphatically} do not work in
    co-moving frames.}
    \PC{unhappy about ``moving frames'': misleading, as slice is
     \emph{emphatically} stationary. ''Covariant frames'' move, but we
     do not know how to use them
     }


The main message of this paper is that if a problem has a continuous
symmetry, the symmetry \emph{must} be used to simplify it. Ignore it at
your own peril, as has been done so far in \KS\rf{Christiansen97}
and \pCf\rf{GHCW07}; the invariant solutions found by restricting
searches to the discrete-symmetry invariant subspaces have little if
anything to do with the full \statesp\ explored by turbulence, not more
than the \eqv\ points of the Lorenz equation have to do with its strange
attractor. Symmetry reduction by \mslices\ is numerically efficient.
Coupled with our \statesp\ visualizations allows for explorations of
high-dimensional flows that hitherto were unthinkable. Symmetry reduction
is here achieved, and now all pipe flow solutions can be plotted
together, as one happy family: all points equivalent by symmetries are
represented by a single point, families of solutions are mapped to a
single solution, \reqva\ become \eqva, and \rpo s become \po s. Without
symmetry reduction, no full understanding of pipe and plane \pCf s is
possible.

        \PC{2012-03-14 this is a repeat of an earlier sentence}
    \PC{2011-10-18 incorporate this paragraph:``
Note also that the rotation of a fluid flow into a \slice\ {\em is not}
an average over the 3D pipe azimuthal angle, it is the full snapshot of
the flow embedded in the $\infty$-dimensional \statesp. Symmetry
reduction is not a dimensional-reduction scheme, or flow modeling by
fewer degrees of freedom: the \reducedsp\ is also $\infty$-dimensional
and no information is lost, one can go freely between solutions in the
full and reduced \statesp s by integrating the associated
\emph{reconstruction equations}.
