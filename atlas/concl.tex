As a turbulent flow evolves, every so often we catch a glimpse of a
familiar structure. For any finite spatial resolution, the flow follows
for a finite time an unstable {\cohStr} belonging to an alphabet of
admissible states, represented here by a set of \reqva\ and \rpo s. In
presence of symmetries, these recurrences can be identified only if
shifted both in time (period \period{p}) and space (phase shift
$\shift_p$).

In the \mslices\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000,BeTh04,SiCvi10,FrCv11} the
symmetry reduction is achieved by cutting the group orbits with a finite
set of hyperplanes, one for each continuous group parameter, with each
group orbit of symmetry-equivalent points represented by a single point,
its intersection with the \slice.

The main message of this paper is that if a problem has a continuous
symmetry, the symmetry \emph{must} be used to simplify it. Symmetry
reduction is here achieved, and now all solutions of a turbulent flow can
be plotted together, as one happy family: all symmetry-equivalent states
are represented by a single point, families of solutions are mapped to a
single solution, \reqva\ become \eqva, \rpo s become \po s, and the
global dynamical systems analysis if terms of invariant solutions and
their stable / unstable manifolds is now made possible.

    \PC{2012-03-14 this is a repeat of an earlier sentence}
    \PC{2011-10-18 incorporate this paragraph:``
Note also that the rotation of a fluid flow into a \slice\ {\em is not}
an average over the 3D pipe azimuthal angle, it is the full snapshot of
the flow embedded in the $\infty$-dimensional \statesp. Symmetry
reduction is not a dimensional-reduction scheme, or flow modeling by
fewer degrees of freedom: the \reducedsp\ is also $\infty$-dimensional
and no information is lost, one can go freely between solutions in the
full and reduced \statesp s by integrating the associated
\emph{reconstruction equations}.
