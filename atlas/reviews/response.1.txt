Dear Professor Holmes:

We are grateful to reviewers 1 and 2 for their detailed comments, and
have tried to incorporate all their suggestions (the edits marked blue

comments are given in attached files.

Assuming that the revisions meet the reviewers' approval, we look forward
to hearing from you on the next steps for publication.

best regards,
