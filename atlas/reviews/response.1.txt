 A visual guide to sections and slices"

29 June 2012

Dear Professor Holmes:

[ THE REST IS THE TEXT FROM ANOTHER RESPONSE, REWRITE! }
Thank you for your efforts on behalf of our submission to CHAOS. We are
pleased with the reviewers' generally positive response and very grateful
for their constructive criticism. We are a particularly grateful for the
detailed comments of reviewers 1 and 2 regarding the organization of the
paper and the review of previous work. On the basis of this advice, we
have entirely rewritten the introduction, combined and condensed the
preliminary sections, and eliminated the appendices, except for the
tables of eigenvalues, which have been reduced. Figure 7 has been also
been revised to simplify its explanation in the text. Responses to
individual reviewer comments are listed in attached files.

Assuming that the revisions meet the reviewers' approval, I look forward
to hearing from you on the next steps for publication.

best regards,
