      Every slice hyperplane cuts every group orbit at least twice (see
      \reffig{fig:slice}), once at orbit's closest passage to the
      {\template}, and another time at the most distant passage, also
      satisfying the slice condition \refeq{PCsectQ0}. An $\SOn{2}$ \rpo\
      is topologically a torus, so the two cuts are the two \po\ images
      of the same \rpo, the good close one, and the bad distant one, on
      the other side of {\sliceBord}, and thus not in the slice.

\ChartBord: For $\SOn{2}$ two hyperplanes are associated with  a given
{\template} \slicep; the slice $\pSRed$, and the hyperplane of points
$\sspSing$ normal to \refeq{sliceSingl0}, the quadratic Casimir-weighted
vector $\Lg^2\slicep$. The intersection of the two hyperplanes is the
$(d\!-\!2)$\dmn\ hyperplane {\em \chartBord} $\sspRSing \in {\cal S}$, within
which all group tangents $\groupTan(\sspRSing)$ lie in the slice and are
thus normal to $\sliceTan{}$. Beyond this boundary, the group orbits
pierce the \slice\ hyperplane in the wrong direction, so only the
half-hyperplane that contains the \template\ belongs to the slice. The
{\chartBord} is not easy to visualize; For the lack of dimensions, here
it is drawn here as a `line,' the $z$ axis in this 3\dmn\ sketch. (a) If
the equivariant coordinates transform only under the $m=1$ representation
of $\SOn{2}$, every group orbit is a circle, and crosses any
hyperplane twice. However, if there are coordinates that transform as
higher $m$, group orbit can pierce the hyperplane up to $2m$ times, and
the {\chartBord} lies closer to the template. (b) For example, a group
orbit for a combination of $m=1$ and $m=2$ equivariant coordinates
resembles a baseball seam, and can be sliced 4 times, out of which only
the point closest to the \template\ is in the slice (from \wwwcb{}).

A 2-chart atlas.
    (c)
Now that the group orbits have been reduced to points, erase them and
consider the two slices through the two {\template s}. As these two
{\template s} are the closest points viewed from either group orbit, they
lie in both \slice s. However, the two tangent vectors
$\sliceTan{}{}^{(1)}$ and $\sliceTan{}{}^{(2)}$ have different
orientations, so they define two distinct \slice\ hyperplanes
$\pSRed{}^{(1)}$ and $\pSRed{}^{(2)}$ which intersect in the
\emph{ridge}, a hyperplane of dimension $(d\!-\!2)$ (here drawn as a
`line,' and in \reffig{fig:A29-1ridge} as intersection of two `volumes')
shared by the template pair that satisfies both \slice\ conditions
\refeq{ridge}. The chart for the neighborhood of each template (a page of
the atlas in part (d)) extends only as far as this ridge. If the
templates are sufficiently close, the {\chartBord} of each \slice\ (red
region) is beyond this ridge, and not encountered by the symmetry-reduced
trajectory $\sspRed(\zeit)$. The reduced trajectory is continuous in the
slice comprised of such charts - it switches the chart whenever it
crosses a ridge.
    (d)
The slice (unique point for each group orbit) is now covered by an atlas
consisting of $(d\!-\!1)$\dmn\ charts $\pSRed{}^{(1)}, \pSRed{}^{(2)},
\cdots$

are oriented, so $\sspRed^*_1$ and $\sspRed^*_2$ are in the section, but

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A local hyperplane segment of the \slice\ is good only up to the
\sliceBord.

Locally, our initial \slice\ chart $\pSRed{}^{(1)}$ is a ($d\!-\!1$)\dmn\
hyperplane. If we pick another {\template} point $\slicep{}^{(2)}$, it
comes along with its own \slice\ hyperplane $\pSRed{}^{(2)}$. Any pair of
$(d\!-\!1)$\dmn\ local \slice\ hyperplanes intersects in a \emph{ridge},
a $(d\!-\!2)$\dmn\ hyperplane {\PoincS} (drawn in
\reffig{fig:A29-2slices}\,({\it c}) as a `line' and in
\reffig{fig:A29-1ridge} as a `plane' of intersection of two volumes)
shared by a pair of charts and thus satisfies both \slice\ conditions
\refeq{PCsectQ0},
\beq
\braket{\sspRed^*}{\sliceTan{}{}^{(1)}} = 0
\mbox{ and }
\braket{\sspRed^*}{\sliceTan{}{}^{(2)}} = 0
    \,.
\ee{ridge}

The rest is geometry of hyperplanes, nothing to do with dynamics, only
with the group theory. In particular, while we motivated slicing by
emphasizing that the choice of templates is where the nonlinear physics
enters, the \slice, \chartBord\ and ridge conditions \refeq{PCsectQ0},
\refeq{eq:chartBord} and \refeq{ridge} are all linear conditions which
depend on the ray defined by the \template\ \slicep, not its magnitude.
Checking whether the {\chartBord} is on the far side of the ridge between
two \slice s is a linear computation; for a symmetry-reduced trajectory
moving in $\pSRed{}^{(1)}$ slice one only has to keep checking the sign
of
\beq
\braket{\sspRed(\zeit)}{\sliceTan{}{}^{(2)}}
\,.
\ee{eq:chartBord}
Once this changes the sign, the ridge has been crossed, and from then on
the trajectory should be reduced to the $\pSRed{}^{(2)}$ slice.

Two-chart atlas works as long you follow a trajectory from a chart to the
next chart, but as the manifold is curved, you will at some point have to
ponder matching ridges of 3 charts together. You'll cross that bridge
when you come to it.

Group orbits $\pS_{\slicep}$, group tangents $\groupTan(\slicep)$ and the
associated \slice s are purely group-theoretic, linear concepts: they
know nothing about dynamics. Dynamics enters only through informed
choices of \template s.

The physical task is to, for a given dynamical flow, pick a set of
qualitatively distinct {\template s} (for example, for a turbulent pipe
flow, one typical of 2-roll states, one for 4-roll states, and so on)
whose \slice s  are locally transverse to open sets of nearby orbits, and
which together provide a good atlas for the region of $\pS/\Group$
explored by chaotic trajectories. Each chart $\pS{}^{(j)}$ covers a
neighborhood of an important, qualitatively distinct class of solutions,
of features qualitatively captured by \template\ $\slicep{}^{(j)}$.
Together they provide an atlas -a finite set of hyperplane tiles-
charting the regions of the curved manifold explored by the trajectories
of interest.

{\bf What it is not}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item reduced-dimensionality model: Symmetry reduction is not a
          dimensional-reduction scheme, or flow modeling by fewer degrees
          of freedom: it is a local change of coordinate, with one (or
          $N$) coordinates pointing along the phase directions. The
          $(d\!-\!N)$\dmn\ \reducedsp\ is also $\infty$-dimensional and
          no information is lost, one can go freely between solutions in
          the full and reduced \statesp s by integrating the associated
          {reconstruction equations} \refeq{reconstrEq}.
      \item an atlas is \emph{not needed} for Newton determination of a
            single trajectory; any local section and slice plus time and shift
            constraints is OK, can even move them with each Newton
            iteration. 60,000 \rpo s can be computed\rf{SCD07} this way.
            The question is: what then? and for that you need a good atlas.
