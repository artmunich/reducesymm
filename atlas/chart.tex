As a generic \slice\ \refeq{PCsectQ0} is the set of all group-orbit
points closest to a given {\template}, it slices the group orbits of
\emph{all} full \statesp\ points\rf{FrCv11}. However, there is no single
\slice\ that can do the job well. As the {\nws} of the dynamics is a
highly contorted, nonlinear curved manifold embedded in a
high-dimensional \statesp, any such linearization is good only locally: a
single {\template} cannot be a good match  globally. The variational
distance condition \refeq{PCsectQ0} is an extremum condition, and as the
group orbits of highly nonlinear states are highly contorted (see
\reffig{fig:2830GO6}\,{\it b}), the distance function can have many
extrema, and multiple sections by a \slice\ hyperplane. For example, a
\rpo\ sweeps out a torus, and is always intersected by a \slice\
hyperplane in two or more \po\ sections, once at the orbit's closest
passage to the template, and another time at the most distant passage,
also satisfying the slice condition  \refeq{PCsectQ0} (see
\reffig{fig:sliceimage}\,{\it a}).

Wurst, sliced.
      Every slice hyperplane cuts every group orbit at least twice (see
      \reffig{fig:slice}), once at orbit's closest passage to the
      {\template}, and another time at the most distant passage, also
      satisfying the slice condition \refeq{PCsectQ0}. An $\SOn{2}$ \rpo\
      is topologically a torus, so the two cuts are the two \po\ images
      of the same \rpo, the good close one, and the bad distant one, on
      the other side of {\sliceBord}, and thus not in the slice. Here
      this is illustrated by close cut (blue) of the \rpo\ $\RPO{36.92}$
      torus, \reffig{f:MeanVelocityFrame}\,({\it b}), plotted together
      with the most distant cut (red), in the same slice hyperplane, but
      not in the slice.

 \caption{\label{fig:A29-2slices}
A 2-chart atlas. Sketch
    (a)
depicts two templates $\slicep{}^{(1)}$, $\ssp'{}^{(2)}$, each with its
group orbit. Start with the {\template} $\slicep{}^{(1)}$. All group
orbits traverse its $(d\!-\!1)$\dmn\ slice hyperplane, including the
group orbit of the second {\template} $\ssp'{}^{(2)}$. Replace the second
{\template} by its closest group-orbit point $\slicep{}^{(2)}$, \ie, the
point in \slice\ $\pSRed{}^{(1)}$.
    (b)
Now that the group orbits have been reduced to points, consider the two
slices through the two {\template s}. As these two {\template s} are the
closest points viewed from either group orbit, they lie in both \slice s.
However, the two tangent vectors $\sliceTan{}{}^{(1)}$ and
$\sliceTan{}{}^{(2)}$ have different orientations, so they define two
distinct \slice\ hyperplanes $\pSRed{}^{(1)}$ and $\pSRed{}^{(2)}$ which
intersect in the \emph{ridge}, a hyperplane of dimension $(d\!-\!2)$
(here drawn as a `line') shared by the template pair. The chart for the
neighborhood of each template (a page of the atlas on the right side of
the figure) extends only as far as this ridge. If the templates are
sufficiently close, the {\chartBord} of each \slice\ (red region) is
beyond this ridge, and never encountered by the symmetry-reduced
trajectory $\sspRed(\zeit)$. The reduced trajectory is continuous in the
slice comprised of such charts - it switches the chart whenever it
crosses a ridge.
    (c)
The slice (unique point for each group orbit) is now covered by an atlas
consisting of $(d\!-\!1)$\dmn\ charts $\pSRed{}^{(1)}, \pSRed{}^{(2)},
\cdots$
(from \wwwcb{}).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A \slice\ hyperplane captures faithfully neighboring group orbits until,
for a point $\sspRSing$ not so close to the \template, its tangent vector
lies in the \slice,
% \(\braket{\groupTan(\sspRSing)}{\sliceTan{}}= 0 \,,\)
and its group orbit is grazed tangentially rather than sliced
transversally. The {\phaseVel} $\dot{\gSpace}(\sspRSing)$ in
\refeq{reconstrEq} then diverges. This is also a linear condition, and it
defines the {\sliceBord} $S$, a hyperplane in which both points
$\sspRSing$ and their group tangents $\groupTan(\sspRSing)$ lie in the
{\slice}\rf{FrCv11},
    %$(d\!-\!2)$\dmn\

\beq
\braket{\sspRSing}{\sliceTan{}} \,=\, 0
      \mbox{ and }
\braket{\groupTan(\sspRSing)}{\sliceTan{}} \,=\, 0
\,.
\label{sliceSingl0}
\eeq
A local hyperplane segment of the \slice\ is good only up to the
\sliceBord. The apparent divergence in {\phaseVel} \refeq{reconstrEq} is
a non-physical artifact of the symmetry reduction by tangent hyperplanes,
but a numerical nuisance nevertheless. Here is how we avoid it.

Locally, our initial \slice\ chart $\pSRed{}^{(1)}$ is a ($d\!-\!1$)\dmn\
hyperplane. If we pick another {\template} point $\slicep{}^{(2)}$, it
comes along with its own \slice\ hyperplane $\pSRed{}^{(2)}$. Any
neighboring pair of $(d\!-\!1)$\dmn\ local \slice\ hyperplanes intersects
in a `ridge', a $(d\!-\!2)$\dmn\ hyperplane, easy to compute (see
\reffig{fig:A29-2slices}). The rest is geometry of hyperplanes (nothing
to do with dynamics, only with the group theory). Checking whether the
{\chartBord} is on the far side of the ridge between two \slice
s is a linear computation, to be undertaken independently of dynamics.
For a reduced trajectory moving in $\pSRed{}^{(1)}$ slice one only has to
keep checking the sign of
\[
\braket{(\sspRed(\zeit)- \slicep{}^{(2)})}{\sliceTan{}{}^{(2)}}
\,.
\]
Once this changes the sign, the ridge has been crossed, and from then on the
trajectory should be reduced to the $\pSRed{}^{(2)}$ slice. There is no need to
pinpoint this crossing accurately, as long $\sspRed(\zeit)$ stays well clear of
all \chartBord s.

Group orbits $\pS_{\slicep}$, group tangents $\groupTan(\slicep)$ and the
associated \slice s are purely group-theoretic, linear concepts: they
know nothing about dynamics. Dynamics enters only through informed
choices of \template s.

The physical task is to, for a given dynamical flow, pick a set of
qualitatively distinct {\template s} (for example, one typical of 2-roll
states, one for 4-roll states, and so on) whose \slice s  are locally
transverse to open sets of nearby orbits, and which together provide a
good global atlas of $\pS/\Group$. Each \slice\ $\pS{}^{(j)}$, provides a
local chart at $\slicep{}^{(j)}$ for a neighborhood of an important,
qualitatively distinct class of solutions. Together they `Voronoi'
tessellate  the curved manifold in which the symmetry-reduced strange
attractor is embedded by a finite set of hyperplane tiles.

We have no advice on how to
systematically pick the individual \template s, other than that the
associated \slice\ tiles should be sufficiently small to exclude
group-orbit tangencies, \ie, stop before crossing their {\chartBord}s \refeq{sliceSingl0}.

Thus, in order to chart the \statesp\ of a chaotic flow, a set
of local \slice\ hyperplanes is needed to capture all of the asymptotic
dynamics. The choice of local \slice s should reflect the dynamically
dominant patterns seen in the solutions of nonlinear PDEs. We construct a
global atlas of the dimensionally \reducedsp\ $\pSRed = \pS/\Group$ by
deploying local linear \slice s  $\pS{}^{(j)}$ across neighborhoods of
the qualitatively most important \template\ {\cohStr s}
$\slicep{}^{(j)}$. For example, in reducing chaotic trajectories of
\refsect{s:rpos}, we use a set of \reqva\ as our \template s, see
\reffig{fig:thetadot2}.

\subsection{Scientists love symmetry. Nature does not}\
``The origin'' or the invariant, fixed-point subspace is a
high-dimensional center space of points not moved by $\Lg_{\theta}$. For
\pCf\ it is the space plumbers prefer to compute in, even though all
turbulence is in the full \statesp. The reason why I really, really want
us to understand what is going on with our atlas in \reffig{fig:A29-2slices}
is that the singularities might be genuine, due to close passages to this
center space, and not taken care of by $\sspRSing$ (which all also
include the `origin'), not just due to bad choice of \template s.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item an atlas is \emph{not needed} for Newton determination of a
            single orbit; any local section and slice plus time and shift
            constraints is OK, can even move them with each Newton
            iteration. 60,000 \rpo s can be computed\rf{SCD07} this way.
            The question is: what then? and for that you need a good atlas.
    \end{itemize}
