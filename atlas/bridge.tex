\section{Bridges to nowhere}
\label{s:bridge}

You can safely skip this section, unless you would like to join a brief
tour of the graveyard of obvious ideas and pet symmetry reduction schemes
that all have one thing in common: they do not work.

Everybody and her mother encounters a symmetry sooner or later, so
literature on symmetry reduction is vast.
For a history, see remarks in ChaosBook.org and \refref{SiCvi10}.


{\bf Method of connections}

    (a)
By equivariance $\vel(\ssp)$ can be replaced by $\vel_\bot(\ssp)$, the
velocity normal to the group tangent directions at \statesp\ point $\ssp$.
    (b)
Method of connections replaces $\vel(\sspRed)$ at every instant
$\sspRed =\sspRed(\zeit)$ by $\vel_\bot(\sspRed)$, so in
$\sspRed(\zeit)$ co-moving frame there is no motion along the group
tangent directions.

{\bf A co-moving frame}
Visualizing a single `relative' trajectory in its co-moving frame, moving with
the mean {\phaseVel} of a given solution, is useful if we are
concerned with that individual solution.
    \PC{cite Golubitsky}
A co-moving frame is useless if
we are concerned with studying collections of these trajectories, as each
solution travels with its own mean {\phaseVel}, and there is no single
co-moving frame that can simultaneously reduce \emph{all} traveling
solutions.
    \PC{disparage co-moving frames: they are misleading for \rpo s, as they
    misrepresent time segments for which a \po\ might be glued to
    barely unstable \eqv. A co-moving frame rotates with the constant
    mean
    $\timeAver{\velRel}= \shift_p/\period{p}
    \,.
    $ We \emph{emphatically} do not work in
    co-moving frames.}
    \PC{unhappy about ``moving frames'': misleading, as slice is
     \emph{emphatically} stationary. ''Covariant frames'' move, but we
     do not know how to use them
     }
    \PC{2012-04-12 - reuse this?: ``
    As long as one is focusing on a single solution of \NSe, there are many
    excellent, physically insightful $3D$ visualizations of the flow:
    velocity fields on flow sections, isovorticity surfaces, videos of the
    flow, and so on. But today we own dozens of exact \eqv\ and \reqv\
    solutions for a given turbulent flow, and we are commencing an exploration of
    states of turbulent fluids in terms of the unstable \po\ solutions whose
    number, as a function of the increasing period, is growing exponentially.
    How are we to visualize \emph{the totality} of these solutions in one go?

Purely group-theoretical, no dynamics to inform it.

{\bf Polar coordinates}

even for pipe flows one does not use cylindrical Bessel functions
eigenbasis.

{\bf Hilbert bases}

    \DB{2012-04-10}
    {A book report on Hilbert bases by Daniel Borrero}
One approach to symmetry reduction that is often used for low-dimensional
dynamical systems is to rewrite the dynamics in terms of a Hilbert
invariant polynomial basis (see \refref{GL-Gil07b} for a clear and
detailed discussion of this method). The idea here is that one can take
the dynamics in equivariant state space coordinates
$(x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_d)$ and rewrite them in terms of polynomials of these
variables $(u_1,u_2,u_3,...,u_m)$ that are invariant under the group
action. The algebra required is quite involved and the required
computations become very large for problems with as few as ten
dimensions\rf{gatermannHab}. This makes the method of Hilbert bases
unfeasible for dealing with high-dimensional dynamical systems, such
as turbulent fluid flows.

{\bf Marsdenmania}

Hamiltonian, more complicated
