\section{Bridges to nowhere}
\label{s:bridge}

You can safely skip this section, unless you have a pet symmetry reduction scheme that
beats the slicing proposal hands down.

    at this point the writing abruptly jumps from goody-goody intro for
    the everyman to technical without sufficient warning. Need to segway
    into the group theory stuff. UPDATE 2012-04-10: Definitely improved at this point

    (1) does not imply `reduction' (2) does not conflict with Lie theory
    and gen. relativity meaning of the term
    }
What follows is very much like the the \refsect{s:cut}; due to the linear
action of the symmetry group, 'slicing' is easier that `sectioning', but
more unfamiliar - that is why we started with reviewing Poincar\'e
sections.


Purely group-theoretical, no dynamics to inform it.

{\bf Polar coordinates}

{\bf Hilbert bases}

    \DB{2012-04-10}
    {A book report on Hilbert bases by Daniel Borrero}
One approach to symmetry reduction that is often used for low-dimensional
dynamical systems is to rewrite the dynamics in terms of a Hilbert
invariant polynomial basis (see \refref{GL-Gil07b} for a clear and
detailed discussion of this method). The idea here is that one can take
the dynamics in equivariant state space coordinates
$(x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_d)$ and rewrite them in terms of polynomials of these
variables $(u_1,u_2,u_3,...,u_m)$ that are invariant under the group
action. In general, these polynomials are non-unique and $m \geq d$, so
that the flow becomes embedded in a larger m-dimensional state space.
While these polynomials are linearly independent, they are functionally
dependent by a set of relations called syzygies. The syzygies constrain
the flow to lower dimensional, but non-trivial, manifolds in the
m-dimensional space.

Sometimes the determination of a Hilbert basis can be informed by
intuition about nonlinear preserved quantities such as rotationally
invariant length $r^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_d^2$. In general,
however, there is no general strategy for creating a useful Hilbert
basis. The algebra required is quite involved and the required
computations become very large for problems with as few as ten
dimensions\rf{gatermannHab}. This makes the method of Hilbert bases
unfeasible for dealing with turbulent fluid flows.

{\bf Method of connections}

By equivariance $\vel(\ssp)$ can be replaced by $\vel_\bot(\ssp)$, the
velocity normal to the group tangent directions at \statesp\ point $\ssp$.
    (b)
Method of connections replaces $\vel(\sspRed)$ at every instant
$\sspRed =\sspRed(\zeit)$ by $\vel_\bot(\sspRed)$, so in
$\sspRed(\zeit)$ co-moving frame there is no motion along the group
tangent directions.

{\bf A co-moving frame}
Visualizing a single `relative' trajectory in its co-moving frame, moving with
the mean {\phaseVel} of a given solution, is useful if we are
concerned with that individual solution. A co-moving frame is useless if
we are concerned with studying collections of these trajectories, as each
solution travels with its own mean {\phaseVel}, and there is no single
co-moving frame that can simultaneously reduce \emph{all} traveling
solutions.
    \PC{disparage co-moving frames: they are misleading for \rpo s, as they
    misrepresent time segments for which a \po\ might be glued to
    barely unstable \eqv. A co-moving frame rotates with the constant
    mean
    $\timeAver{\velRel}= \shift_p/\period{p}
    \,.
    $ We \emph{emphatically} do not work in
    co-moving frames.}
    \PC{unhappy about ``moving frames'': misleading, as slice is
     \emph{emphatically} stationary. ''Covariant frames'' move, but we
     do not know how to use them
     }

{\bf What it is not}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item co-moving frame
      \item reduced-dimensionality model: Symmetry reduction is not a
          dimensional-reduction scheme, or flow modeling by fewer degrees
          of freedom: it is a local change of coordinate, with one (or
          $N$) coordinates pointing along the phase directions. The
          $(d\!-\!N)$\dmn\ \reducedsp\ is also $\infty$-dimensional and
          no information is lost, one can go freely between solutions in
          the full and reduced \statesp s by integrating the associated
          {reconstruction equations} \refeq{reconstrEq}.
    \end{itemize}
