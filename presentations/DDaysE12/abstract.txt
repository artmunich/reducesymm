In presence of continuous symmetries, solutions of high-dimensional flows come in families of equivalent states related by a group transformation. In order to understand the topological organization of such flows in terms of dynamically important solutions, one needs to replace the dynamics by a symmetry reduced flow, in which all symmetry related states are replaced by a single representative.

Classical symmetry reduction schemes, such as the Hilbert polynomial basis approach are computationally prohibitive in high-dimensional flows. In the method of slices, which we will employ here, the reduced space is identified with a collection of local charts, each being a hyperplane segment which intersects "group-orbits" transversely. We will demonstrate the method in three systems of physical relavence: 1) the 5-dimensional, SO(2)-equivariant complex Lorenz flow, 2) the 4-dimensional SO(2)-equivariant Porter-Knobloch system and 3) the O(2)-equivariant Kuramoto-Sivashinsky partial differential equation.
