We can write up the narrative starting with this file,
in this folder, \texttt{reducesymm/tingnan/},
with all stuff that does not belong to the public version
bracketed by \texttt{ifboyscout}...\texttt{fi} .
You can clip \& paste anything from here or from
ChaosBook.org, if that saves you LaTeXing time.

\item[2009-02-27 Predrag]
Read  Gilbert  and Lefevere\rf{GilbLef08},

             in locally confined billiard systems,''

``From Deterministic Chaos to Deterministic Diffusion''
by R. Klages, \arXiv{0804.3068}: ``
A set of easy-to-read lecture notes for a short first-year Ph.D.
student course. The notes cover five hours of lectures and
do not require any prior knowledge on dynamical systems. The first part introduces
to deterministic chaos in one-dimensional maps in form of Lyapunov exponents
and the metric entropy. The second part first outlines the concept of
deterministic diffusion. Then the escape rate formalism for deterministic
diffusion, which expresses the diffusion coefficient in terms of the above two
chaos quantities, is worked out for a simple map. The notes conclude with a
very brief sketch of anomalous diffusion.

\item[2013-02-28 Predrag] to Tingnan Zhang:
Dettmann's review, \arXiv{1402.7010} is something that you want to read -
looks very complete. {\bf Goldman:} Sects. 7.4 and 7.5 and refs within
are tantalizing.

\item[2013-03-25 Predrag] to Tingnan Zhang:
{\em Superdiffusion in the periodic Lorentz gas} by
Jens Marklof and Balint Toth,  	\arXiv{1403.6024} is too mathematical and
general for our purposes (hopefully we will have no super-diffusivity, noise
should wipe that out), but
Sect.~2~{\em The scattering map} might be useful for your exposition
(or its prequel  \arXiv{0801.0612}).

\item[2014-04-24 Tingnan]
Remember that some orbits that lie on the boundary of fundamental domain
have only 6 copies.

\item[2014-04-26 Predrag]
All divisors of 12 are possible multiplicites. The fully symmetric state
of multiplicity 1 would be an \eqv\ point at the origin: possible for
soft potentials but not for this billiard. Rest you can easily doodle if
you draw the hexagonal lattice (disks replaced by point): there is \po\
of length 6 (edges of the hexagon) of multiplicity 2 (the two
orientations of the orbit), and there should be orbits of multiplicity 3,
4, 6 and the generic asymmetric orbits of multiplicity 12.

\item[2014-04-24 Pavel]
Tingan and I have realized that in a
pseudo-cycle it is possible to have two or more prime cycles that differ
by a group action. In some sense, cross-terms still disappear, but it is
impossible to assign unique weights to each fundamental domain cycle.

\item[2014-04-26 Predrag to Tingan]

Blog about relevant parts here, if there is something of interest
to us.

\item[2014-04-26 Predrag]
If we succeed in factorization, this would merit a publication.
It is OK if you do not succeed in factorization - I have failed myself, so
who am I to cast the first stone:)

\item[2014-05-02 Predrag]
Pavel again has an idea. Forget the translation group; tile every Lorentz
gas orbit by the little triangles (copies of the fundamental domain,
1/12th of the elementary cell). Then the group orbit is generated by 3
elements (ignoring going through the corners): go to the domain to the
left/right (generators of \Dn{12}) and flip the domain so it leaves the
elementary cell. To Predrag this is reminiscent of Penrose tailings,
where the space is tiled without the translations over square or cubic
lattice. For that, Mermin's article\rf{Mermin92} on space groups of
quasicrystals might be of interest.

I think the idea should be worked out in one dimension first, but Pavel
thinks that would be too simple. Predrag believes that you always work
out the simplest model first. $\ExpaEig =2$ vanishes by eq.~(25.20)
(\HREF{http://www.streamsound.dk/book1/chaos/chaos.html\#535/z} {click
here}), so the simplest diffusion models are for $\ExpaEig =3$ or $4$.
Reduce the map to the fundamental domain (positive 1/2 line) as in
ChaosBook fig.~9.8: The bimodal Ulam sawtooth map
(\HREF{http://www.streamsound.dk/book1/chaos/chaos.html\#186/z} {click
here}). That should give the symmetry-reduced symbolic dynamics, but the
group is larger than \Dn{1}, which works `within the elementary cell', by
generating the negative axis copy of the fundamental domain: one adds a
reflection that flips the flips the fundamental domain (the half-unit
interval) outside of the elementary cell, to the adjoining tile (the
second one to the left or the right. This operation generates the
translations, and together the two group operations assign a symbolic
itinerary to any orbit. Then one should find the rule that reads of the
global translation from the symbolic itinerary, insert this into the
cycle expansions for the deterministic diffusion formula.

For $\ExpaEig =2$ I get that the fundamental domain dynamics is given by
the full tent map
(\HREF{http://www.streamsound.dk/book1/chaos/chaos.html\#244/z} {click
here}), so it cannot be simpler. Too bad that $D=0$ identically :)

\item[2014-05-03 Predrag] I drew by hand the $\Dn{1}$ reduction of the
dynamics to the fundamental domain for $\ExpaEig =3$ case - it is really
simple and it works. Guys, try it, then try it for the Lorenz gas. I'm
optimistic.

\item[2014-05-03 Predrag] Pavel is right - 1D case is probably
misleading, I used only translations to find the global displacement.
With reflections, the distances on the 2D lattice corresponding to
relative prime cycles will not be integer vectors - their construction
will resemble what we do when we bounce a straight trajectory off a
sequence of 3-disks, it will be a computation, and go to the new
`comoving' coordinate frame. But a doable one. Maybe one should play with
the least symmetric triangular $p3$ ($\Zn{3}$ point group) tiling first,
rather than with the most symmetric hexagonal $p6mm$ lattice ($\Dn{6}$
point group).

\item[2014-05-05 Tingnan] My numbers of elementary cell prime cycles,
Lyapunov exponents and diffusion coefficients are listed and compared
to the Schreiber calculation in \reftab{TCELL1}. I still have the problem
for the convergence of diffusion coefficients. Did we miss a factor of 2
somewhere?

Note that while Tingnan more prime periodic orbits than Thomas Schreiber,
convergence is not improved.
%To the contrary: the diffusion constant and
%the Lyapunov exponent of \reftab{TCELL1} do not agree for even $\cl{}=2$,
%so something is seriously amiss. It is unlikely that Thomas and
%I would have gotten that wrong.
Have to

  (c) $\period{p}$, and
  (d) $\hn_t(x)$, the discrete lattice translation \refeq{hatn}.

\item[2014-05-18 Predrag to Tingnan] Thanks for checking - your
    numerics is 100\% good, great. I reformatted
    \reftab{tab:ListLength2} - nothing important. For some reason the
    Floquet multipliers for the \cycle{59} set are accurate only to
    $10^{-8}$, even though your check of analytic formulas are good to
    $10^{-15}$. Not a pressing problem at the moment...

\item[2014-05-20 Predrag]
Elementary cell symbolic dynamics labels are not disk labels, but rather
the labels of transitions between disks along the 12 translational
vectors. In \reffig{diskDirectionsElCell} I label the
translation vectors connecting the center of the current disk to the
center of the next disk.

\item[2014-05-21 Tingnan]
I migrated my code base to cpp for
faster computing speed (in order to find periodic orbits of topological
length 8). I will try both derivative-free (Nelder-Mead) routine as well
as those methods based on derivatives. The multi-dimensional flight time
function (to be minimized) seems to have a quite complex landscape which
creates a lot of numerical difficulties. Do you know which references
have figures/tables showing the diffusion coefficient/flight time/etc as
a function of some parameters? Insofar I can only find estimations on
hard disks as a function of disk separation $w$. I am looking at this
because Dan would like to see the parameter variations and their effects,
from an experimental aspect.

\item[2014-05-20 Predrag]
All illustrations seem to be worked out for 1-dimensional maps (see
references toward the beginning of this blog). We would be the first to
compute something for Lorentz billiard, I believe.

\item[2014-05-20 Predrag]
Regarding spherical billiards for Feifei Qian: there is lots of
literature on the web, Google it (though I have not found much). Random
reference: Donnay\rf{Donnay88}
(\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/library/Donnay88.pdf}{click here}).
Programming should be easy; each orbit is a great circle. If the billiard
is a sphere with a reflecting circle drawn on, find the intersection of a
great circle with it, the specularly reflect it around the intersection
point. That seems to say that all orbits (with the exception of the
equator parallel to the billiard wall circle) are marginally stable
period 2. So we need to think of something more interesting, like 2
circular billiard walls, not symmetrically placed...

Totally unrelated:

I think I in my and Schreiber's numerical calculation for the diffusion
coefficients we have missed the spatial dimension $\nu=2$ at the
denominator \refeq{TS:formula}. Now results are updated in
\reftab{TCELL}. Should we say that now both Lyapunov and diffusion
coefficient are converged?

You are right about Schreiber missing $\nu=2$; I have it in my overheads.
The number of cycles seems to be creeping
up (from initial Tingnan's \reftab{TCELL1} to the current \reftab{TCELL}.
I doubt I'll ever find the Schreiber's data, it is so long ago...

%My worry is still that the diffusion constant and
%the Lyapunov exponent of \reftab{TCELL1} do not agree for even $\cl{}=2$, so maybe
%I'll have to recompute \refeq{TS:formula} in this case, using your
%\reftab{tab:ListLength2} data.
The convergence for both the Lyapunov and the diffusion
coefficient seem not very good, but let's see well the Lyapunov works out
once you compute it in the fundamental domain.

\item[05-26-2014 Tingnan]
If I am not wrong the zeta function for $n=2$ and $n=3$ cases are just the summation over the weights (using the truncation formula)
\[
\zeta(0,0)=1-\sum_{\cl{p}\leq2,3}t_{p}=1-\sum_{\cl{p}\leq2,3} \frac{1}{\ExpaEig_{p}}
\]
I am starting to compute the cycles in the fundamental domain.
Not sure how to convert the fundamental domain symbols (a-f, A-F) into my program. Are we still trying to use the least action method in the fundamental domain? If so, for each of the symbol, which disks should be included for the computation? In Fig.~5 of Schreiber paper we can see that the number of the disks visited for each symbol
is different. And I am not sure about this sentence in Schreiber's paper:

``The right and left turns are not distinguished - instead,  one reads
off a symbol whether the next turn has to be taken in the same or in the
opposite sense."

\item[2014-05-28 Predrag] Notions `right' and `left' are well defined in
the elementary cell. In the fundamental domain on indicates only the
successive relative orientations: either one turns in the same sense as
in the preceding turn, or one turns in the sense opposite of the
preceding turn. Is that clearer?

\item[2014-05-28 Tingnan] Now it is clearer. Let me see how the fundamental domain cycle could be computed.

\item[05-26-2014 Tingnan]

I spent some effort trying to derive (21.8, 21.9) in ChaosBook  (\HREF{http://www.streamsound.dk/book1/chaos/chaos.html\#445/z}
{click here}), in preparation to compute the dynamical averages in the fundamental domain.

\begin{align*}
\left\langle \phi\vert\Lop(y,x)\vert\rho\right\rangle  &= \int_{M}dy\int_{M}dx\phi(y)\delta(y-f^{t}(x))\rho(x)\\
 &= \sum_{a,b}^{\vert G\vert}\int_{\tilde{M}_{a}}dx\int_{\tilde{M}_{b}}dy\phi(y)\delta(y-f^{t}(x))\rho(x)\\
 &= \sum_{a,b}^{\vert G\vert}\int_{\tilde{M}}d\tilde{x}\int_{\tilde{M}}d\tilde{y}\phi(\mathbf{b}\tilde{y})\delta(\mathbf{b}\tilde{y}-f^{t}(\mathbf{a}\tilde{x}))\rho(\mathbf{a}\tilde{x})\\
 &= \sum_{a,b}^{\vert G\vert}\int_{\tilde{M}}d\tilde{x}\int_{\tilde{M}}d\tilde{y}\phi(\mathbf{b}\tilde{y})\delta(\tilde{y}-\mathbf{b^{-1}}\mathbf{a}f^{t}(\tilde{x}))\rho(\mathbf{a}\tilde{x})\\
 &= \sum_{h,a,b}^{\vert G\vert}\int_{\tilde{M}}d\tilde{x}\int_{\tilde{M}}d\tilde{y}\phi(\mathbf{b}\tilde{y})\delta_{h,b^{-1}a}\delta(\mathbf{h^{-1}}\tilde{y}-f(\tilde{x}))\rho(\mathbf{a}\tilde{x})
\end{align*}
where we have used the fact that $\det \vert a\vert=1$(e.g.
rotation or translation). The product of two group actions $b^{-1}a$
determines the relative ``displacement'' in the group space. We
can then write the evolution operator using the left regular representation
$D(h)_{ba}=\delta h,b^{-1}a$, as:
\[
\Lop(y,x)=\sum_{h,ab}^{\vert G\vert}D(h)_{ba}\delta(\mathbf{h}^{-1}\tilde{y}-f(\tilde{x}))=\sum_{h,ab}^{\vert G\vert}D(h)_{ba}\Lop(\mathbf{h}^{-1}\tilde{y},\tilde{x})
\]
The linear property of the evolution operator could be written as:
\[
\Lop(z,y)\Lop(y,x)=\sum_{hh^{\prime},abb^{\prime}}^{\vert G\vert}D(h^{\prime})_{b^{'}b}D(h)_{ba}\Lop(\mathbf{h}^{\prime-1}\tilde{z},\tilde{y})\Lop(\mathbf{h}^{-1}\tilde{y},\tilde{x})
\]
Note that $D(h^{\prime})_{b^{'}b}D(h)_{ba}$ multiplies as matrices.

The trace formula in the fundamental domain can now been written as:
\begin{align*}
\tr  \Lop &= \int_{\tilde{M}}d\tilde{x}\sum_{h,aa}^{\vert G\vert}D(h)_{aa}\Lop(\mathbf{h}^{-1}\tilde{x},\tilde{x})\\
 &= \int_{\tilde{M}}d\tilde{x}\sum_{h}^{\vert G\vert}\Tr D(h)\Lop(\mathbf{h}^{-1}\tilde{x},\tilde{x})
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
\tr  \Lop^{2} &= \int_{\tilde{M}}d\tilde{x}\int_{\tilde{M}}d\tilde{y}\sum_{hh^{\prime},ab^{\prime}}^{\vert G\vert}D(h^{\prime})_{ab}D(h)_{ba}\Lop(\mathbf{h}^{\prime-1}\tilde{x},\tilde{y})\Lop(\mathbf{h}^{-1}\tilde{y},\tilde{x})\\
 &= \int_{\tilde{M}}d\tilde{x}\int_{\tilde{M}}d\tilde{y}\sum_{h^{\prime}h}^{\vert G\vert}D(h^{\prime}h)_{aa}\Lop(\mathbf{h}^{\prime-1}\tilde{x},\tilde{y})\Lop(\mathbf{h}^{-1}\tilde{y},\tilde{x})\\
 &= \int_{\tilde{M}}d\tilde{x}\int_{\tilde{M}}d\tilde{y}\sum_{h^{\prime}}^{\vert G\vert}\Tr  D(h^{\prime}h)\Lop(\mathbf{h}^{\prime-1}\tilde{x},\tilde{y})\Lop(\mathbf{h}^{-1}\tilde{y},\tilde{x})\\
 &= \int_{\tilde{M}}d\tilde{x}\sum_{h^{\prime}h\equiv e}^{\vert G\vert}\Tr  D(h^{\prime}h)\Lop(\mathbf{h}^{\prime-1}\tilde{x},\mathbf{h}f(\tilde{x}))\\
 &= \int_{\tilde{M}}d\tilde{x}\sum_{h^{\prime}}^{\vert G\vert}\Tr  D(h^{\prime})\Lop^{2}(\mathbf{h}^{\prime-1}\tilde{x},\tilde{x})
\end{align*}

Next, we will derive the formula for the {\Fd} in the
fundamental domain.
\begin{align*}
\Tr  \Lop^{t} &= \int_{\mathcal{M}}\Lop^{t}(x,x)dx\\
 &= \int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{x}\sum_{h,a}^{G}D_{aa}(h)\delta(\mathbf{h}^{-1}\tilde{x}-f^{t}(\tilde{x}))e^{\beta\cdot A^{t}(\mathbf{a}\tilde{x})}\\
 &= \sum_{h,a}^{G}D_{aa}(h)\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{x}\delta(\mathbf{h}^{-1}\tilde{x}-f^{t}(\tilde{x}))e^{\beta\cdot A^{t}(\mathbf{a}\tilde{x})}\\
 &= \sum_{a}^{G}D_{aa}(h)\sum_{\tilde{x_{i}}:\mathbf{h}f^{t}(\tilde{x_{i}})=\tilde{x_{i}}}\frac{e^{\beta\cdot A^{t}(\mathbf{a}\tilde{x_{i}})}}{\vert\det (1-\mathbf{h}J^{t}(\tilde{x_{i}}))\vert}\\
 &= \sum_{a}^{G}\sum_{\tilde{x_{i}}:f^{t}(\tilde{x_{i}})=\tilde{x_{i}}}\frac{e^{\beta\cdot A^{t}(\mathbf{a}\tilde{x_{i}})}}{\vert\det (1-J^{t}(\tilde{x_{i}}))\vert}
\end{align*}
Now I seem to run into an issue: the trace only depends on those
standing global orbits, and it does not take any contributions from
those runaway orbits.

\item[2014-05-28 Predrag]
That's why I spent two weeks fumbling to derive trace formulas in
presence of symmetries: `running orbits' are the \rpo s associated with
the translations of the hexagonal lattice. Ask Xiong Ding to explain
this. He understands the discrete case, is still trying to understand the
continuous symmetry case. In other words, why does Kronecker delta take
values 0 or 1, but the Dirac delta function has values 0 or $\infty$ :)

\item[2014-05-28 Tingnan]

I got it!

A careful re-derivation of the trace formula gives
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Tr}\mathcal{L} & =\int dx\int dy\delta(x-y)\mathcal{L}(y,x)\\
 & =\vert G\vert^{2}\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{x}\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{y}\frac{1}{\vert G\vert}\sum_{a}\frac{1}{\vert G\vert}\sum_{b}\delta(\mathbf{a}\tilde{x}-\mathbf{b}\tilde{y})\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{b}\tilde{y},\mathbf{a}\tilde{x})\\
 & =\vert G\vert^{2}\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{x}\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{y}\frac{1}{\vert G\vert}\sum_{a}\frac{1}{\vert G\vert}\sum_{b}\delta(\mathbf{a}\tilde{x}-\mathbf{b}\tilde{y})\delta(\tilde{y}-\mathbf{b^{-1}a}f^{t}(\tilde{x}))\\
 & =\vert G\vert^{2}\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{x}\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{y}\underbrace{\frac{1}{\vert G\vert}\sum_{a}}\frac{1}{\vert G\vert}\sum_{h}\delta(\tilde{y}-\mathbf{h}\tilde{x})\delta(\tilde{y}-\mathbf{h}f^{t}(\tilde{x}))\\
 & =\vert G\vert^{2}\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{x}\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{y}\frac{1}{\vert G\vert}\sum_{h}\delta(\tilde{y}-\mathbf{h}\tilde{x})\delta(\tilde{y}-\mathbf{h}f^{t}(\tilde{x}))\\
 & =\vert G\vert\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{x}\sum_{h}\delta(\tilde{x}-\mathbf{h}f^{t}(\tilde{x}))
\end{align*}

The trick is within the double delta function that I previously ignored: both of them would contribute when integrating over $\tilde{y}$.

For the modified evolution operator the trace in the fundamental domain, we now have:

\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Tr}\mathcal{L}^{t} & =\vert G\vert^{2}\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{x}\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{y}\frac{1}{\vert G\vert}\sum_{a}\frac{1}{\vert G\vert}\sum_{b}\delta(\mathbf{a}\tilde{x}-\mathbf{b}\tilde{y})\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{b}\tilde{y},\mathbf{a}\tilde{x})\\
 & =\vert G\vert^{2}\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{x}\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{y}\frac{1}{\vert G\vert}\sum_{a}\frac{1}{\vert G\vert}\sum_{b}\delta(\mathbf{b^{-1}a}\tilde{x}-\tilde{y})\delta(\tilde{y}-\mathbf{b^{-1}a}f^{t}(\tilde{x}))e^{\beta\cdot A^{t}(\mathbf{a}\tilde{x})}\\
 & =\vert G\vert\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{x}\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{y}\sum_{h}\delta(\tilde{y}-\mathbf{h}\tilde{x})\delta(\tilde{y}-\mathbf{h}f^{t}(\tilde{x}))\frac{1}{\vert G\vert}\sum_{a}e^{\beta\cdot A^{t}(\mathbf{a}\tilde{x})}\\
 & =\vert G\vert\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}d\tilde{x}\sum_{h}\delta(\tilde{x}-\mathbf{h}f^{t}(\tilde{x}))\frac{1}{\vert G\vert}\sum_{a}e^{\beta\cdot A^{t}(\mathbf{a}\tilde{x})}
\end{align*}

I see the trouble more clearly as indicated in the previous blogs: The
averaging over the space group (a point group action followed by a
translation). I think in Pavel's approach we still needs to worry
because his three group actions do not commute with each other?

\item[05-26-2014 Tingnan to Pavel]

Here I put some essential ideas of dynamical averaging. This section could be though as a short version of what has been covered from Chapter 17 to 20 in the book.

Put the quantity that needs to be averaged to exponential
\[
\left\langle e^{\beta\cdot A^{t}}\right\rangle =\frac{1}{\vert M\vert}\int dxe^{\beta\cdot A^{t}(x)}
\]
where $A^{t}(x)=\int_{0}^{t}d\tau a[f^{t}(x)]$. When divided by $t$
this gives the time average. The quantity we are interested can be
obtained by partial differentiation:
\[
\left\langle A^{t}\right\rangle =\frac{\partial}{\partial\beta}\left.\left\langle e^{\beta\cdot A^{t}}\right\rangle \right|_{\beta=0}
\]
The term $\left\langle e^{\beta\cdot A^{t}}\right\rangle $ is expected
to grow exponentially in time and is dominated by the leading eigenvalue
of the evolution operator:
\[
\left\langle e^{\beta\cdot A^{t}}\right\rangle \to(\mathrm{const})e^{ts(\beta)}
\]
The function $s(\beta)=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{1}{t}\ln\left\langle e^{\beta\cdot A^{t}}\right\rangle $
is related to the observable as:
\begin{align*}
\left.\frac{\partial s}{\partial\beta}\right|_{\beta=0} & =\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{1}{t}\left.
\frac{\partial\ln\left\langle e^{\beta\cdot A^{t}}\right\rangle }
     {\partial\beta}\right|_{\beta=0}
   =\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{1}{t}\left\langle A^{t}\right\rangle \\
 & =\left\langle a\right\rangle
\end{align*}
In order to evaluate $s(\beta)$ we will examine the modified  evolution
operator:
\[
\Lop^{t}(y,x)=\delta(y-f^{t}(x))e^{\beta\cdot A^{t}(x)}
\]
It is a linear operator and has its eigen ``vectors'' (in the function
space) and corresponding eigenvalues:
\[
[\Lop^{t}\rho_{\beta}](y)=\int_{\mathcal{M}}dx\delta(y-f^{t}(x))e^{\beta\cdot A^{t}(x)}\rho_{\beta}(x)=e^{ts(\beta)}\rho_{\beta}(y)
\]

So now we turn the problem into: how can be determine the eigenvalues
(the leading one) in the infinite functional space? We can do that
with the help of spectral determinant. Suppose we have discrete mappings
and set $\Lop\equiv\Lop^{1}$. By evaluating the zeros
of the determinant
\[
\det (1-z\Lop)=\prod_{k}(1-z \lambda_{k})
\]
one can get all eigenvalues $\lambda_{k}$s of the linear operator.
The LHS can be rewritten as exponentials:
\[
\det (1-z\Lop)=\exp\left(-\sum_{n}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{n}\Tr  \Lop^{n}\right)
\]
Now the cycle expansion will help us determine the trace of the linear
operator.

\begin{align*}
\Tr  \Lop^{n} & =\int_{\mathcal{M}}\Lop^{n}(x,x)dx=\int_{\mathcal{M}}dx\delta(x-f^{n}(x))e^{\beta\cdot A^{n}(x)}\\
 & =\sum_{x_{i}:f^{n}(x_{i})=x_{i}}\frac{e^{\beta\cdot A^{n}(x_{i})}}{\vert\det (1-J^{n}(x_{i}))\vert}
\end{align*}
The summation is over all the periodic orbits of length $n$. We may
write it in terms of prime (distinct) periodic orbits:
\[
\Tr  \Lop^{n}=\sum_{p}\cl{p}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}
\frac{e^{\beta\cdot rA_{p}}}{\vert\det (1-J_{p}^{r})\vert}\delta n,\cl{p}r
\]
where $r$ is the repeat, and $\cl{p}$ is the length of the
prime orbit. A fact: prime periodic orbit of length $\cl{p}$ will
contribute to the sum $\cl{p}$ times for each of the points along
the orbit. Now substitute the trace formula to the determinant, the
summation over $n$ removes the awkward delta function:
\begin{align*}
\det (1-z\Lop) & =\exp\left(-\sum_{n}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{n}\Tr  \Lop^{n}\right)\\
 & =\exp\left(-\sum_{n}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{n}\sum_{p}\cl{p}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{e^{\beta\cdot rA_{p}}}{\vert\det (1-J_{p}^{r})\vert}\delta n,\cl{p}r\right)\\
 & =\exp\left(-\sum_{p}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{r}\frac{z^{\cl{p}r}e^{\beta\cdot rA_{p}}}{\vert\det (1-J_{p}^{r})\vert}\right)
\end{align*}
So far the {\Fd} is exact. If we are interested only in its leading
zero, it can be approximated by keeping only the expanding
eigenvalues of the {\jacobianM},
\begin{align*}
\vert\det (1-J_{p}^{r})\vert
 & =\left|\prod_{e}(1-\ExpaEig_{p,e}^{r})\prod_{c}(1-\ExpaEig_{p,c}^{r})\right|
 =\vert\ExpaEig_{p}\vert^{r}\left|\prod_{e}(1-\frac{1}{\ExpaEig_{p,e}^{r}})
                                  \prod_{c}(1-\ExpaEig_{p,c}^{r})\right|\\
 & =\vert\ExpaEig_{p}\vert^{r}
\,,
\end{align*}
where $\ExpaEig_{p}$ is the product of all the expanding
eigenvalues. In this way the {\Fd} is approximated by the {\dzeta}:
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{\zeta(z,\beta)} & =\exp\left(-\sum_{p}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{r}\frac{z^{\cl{p}r}e^{r\beta\cdot A_{p}}}{\vert\ExpaEig_{p}\vert^{r}}\right)\\
 & =\exp\left(-\sum_{p}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{r}t_{p}^{r}\right)
   =\exp\left(\sum_{p}\ln(1-t_{p})\right)\\
 & =\prod_{p}(1-t_{p})
\,,
\end{align*}
where
\[
t_{p}=\frac{z^{\cl{p}}e^{\beta\cdot A_{p}}}{\vert\ExpaEig_{p}\vert}
\,.
\]
is the weight associated with each prime cycle (for flows we
replace $z$ with $e^{-s}$ and $\cl{p}$ with $\period{p}$). For each
$\beta$, the zeros of {\dzeta}s could be evaluated
numerically.

From the table \reftab{TCELL2} we can see that convergence does not

\reftab{tab:length2withfloquet}, with updated numerical values as well as
the Floquet multipliers.

I also tried to compute the diffusion coefficients for other parameters
(e.g., $w=0.2$). Then I noticed that I can get negative values for
Lyapunov exponents (as sometimes $T$ averaged from the truncation could
be negative). Is it something normal (because of pruning)?

\item[2014-05-28 Predrag]
I believe that for cycle expansions that are too truncated negative
Lyapunovs are possible, because all  fundamental cycles have not been
accounted for yet.

The diffusion constant computed from cycles of length 6 is still
worrisome. We need to understand what happens here. Has the average time
in the numerator of the {\cycForm} \refeq{TS:formula} suddenly jumped
because of the new length 6 periodic orbit, of multiplicity 2?
(See \refFig{7diskFundDflips2}\,(c).)
This cycle is a fixed point in the fundamental domain, so taken care of
in the very first level of computation; there is nothing funny going on
at length 6 in \reftab{TS:CONV}.

\item[2014-05-31 Predrag]
If you ever need to argue that one must reduce the symmetry,
\reftab{tab:addlabel} is your argument. In the elementary cell at
$\cl{}=6$ you pick up \cycle{0\underline{10}8642} and
\cycle{02468\underline{10}}. Try removing them from the sum for
$\spaceAver{\cl{}}_\zeta$: does the mean flight time jump? In the
fundamental domain this short period cycle is a fixed point, accounted
for in the very first step of the calculation.

At $\cl{}=4$  the mean flight time drops precipitously because of
short period cycles such as
\cycle{\underline{10}842}
(see \reffig{schreiberFig3})?

At $\cl{}=5$  the mean flight time is halved again, because of
what short cycles? Can you check if there are 5-cycles with 5 even symbols?

For jumps in the diffusion coefficient the decrease of the mean
lattice displacement presumably comes from running orbits composed
only of short hops - I cannot visualize those, you should check what they look
like in your data set.

Somewhere in Landau \&\ Lifshitz there is a theorem that says (directly
or indirectly) that the diffusion tensor on the hexagonal lattice is
isotropic. (That is not the case on a square lattice - diagonals
$\spaceAver{n_{x}n_{y}}$ are different from $\spaceAver{n_{x}n_{x}}$).
One can probably find the proof or a reference to the theorem in the
literature on lattice gases in 2 dimensions. If that is true, Tingnan's
$\cl{}=6$, $\cl{}=7$ and $\cl{}=8$ are still to be debugged.

Let us expand the $\spaceAver{\period{}}_\zeta$ explicitly to a few
orders, e.g., 4th and 5th order:
\begin{align*}
\spaceAver{\period{}}_\zeta
  &=\sum^{\prime}(-1)^{k}(\tau_{p_1}+\cdots+\tau_{p_k})/\vert\ExpaEig_{p_1}\cdots\ExpaEig_{p_k}\vert\\
  &=(-1)\left(\sum^{n_p\leq5}\frac{\tau_{p_k}}{\vert\ExpaEig_{p_k}\vert} - \sum^{n_{p_{k1}}+n_{p_{k2}}\leq5}\frac{\tau_{p_{k1}}+\tau_{p_{k2}}}{\vert\ExpaEig_{p_{k1}}\ExpaEig_{p_{k2}}\vert} \right)\\
  &=(-1)\left(\underbrace{2.397115663}_{n_p=2} + \underbrace{0.497760092}_{n_p=3} + \underbrace{1.176239465}_{n_p=4} + \underbrace{0.645962664}_{n_p=5}\right.\\
  &\phantom{{}=(-1)}\left.\underbrace{-2.998326076}_{n_{p_1}=2,n_{p_2}=2} - \underbrace{1.193809754}_{n_{p_1}=2,n_{p_2}=3}\right)
\,,
\end{align*}

From what I see, beginning from $n=4$ the pseudo-cycles (in our case
composed of two short prime cycles) start to contribute to the space
averages, and their contributions are larger than those of prime cycles
of the same topological length. Many cycles have long topological length
but short flight time, I will try to identify a few of those.

Beginning from $n=6$, I am missing cycles that are very close to the
tangent, because sometimes the path intersects with a disk due to slight
numerical differences. Say if a cycle is of multiplier $12$ due to
rotational symmetry, I sometimes only find 11 or 10 from this family.
Again, this is probably another argument of why we needs to go to the
fundamental domain.

\item[2014-06-02, 2014-06-08 Predrag]
\refFig{7diskFundDflips}\,(a) illustrates Pavel's three generators. The standard notation
is \refeq{D12generators}, with $s=\sigma_{d}$ the reflection across the
short disk-disk separation, and $\ell=\sigma_{v}$ reflection across the
long disk-disk separation generators of \Dn{12}. The entire space group
is then generated by adding a disk-to-disk generator $f$ that pivots a
disk center to disk center by flip across the symmetry line normal to the
short disk-disk separation.

Few relations:
\[
\ell s = C_6^-
\,,\qquad
s \ell =  C_6^+
\,,\qquad
s  =  C_6^+ \ell
\,.
\]
There are two short paths from disk to disk: $f$, which keeps the sense
of orientation, and $sf=fs$ which changes it. So there should really be
two symbols for each elementary cell symbol. For example, $0=f$ and
$0'=fs$; the difference is better understood as we look at the
fundamental domain fixed points, \ie, sequences containing a single $f$
in \reffig{7diskFundDflips}\,(b):
\bea
\cycle{f} &=& \cycle{06} \,,\qquad \mbox{shift} = 0
    \continue
\cycle{fs} &=&  \cycle{08} =  \cycle{26} \,,\qquad
\mbox{shift} = \jEigvec[0]-\jEigvec[2]
    \continue
\cycle{f\ell} &=&  \cycle{048} \,,\qquad \mbox{shift} = 0
    \continue
\cycle{fs\ell} &=& \cycle{24}
 \,,\qquad \mbox{shift} = 2\jEigvec[0]-\jEigvec[2]
    \continue
\cycle{f\ell s\ell} &=& \cycle{0\underline{10}8642}
 \,,\qquad \mbox{shift} = 0
    \continue
{[} \cycle{f s\ell s\ell} &=& \cycle{f \ell s s \ell} = \cycle{f}
 \,,\qquad \mbox{shift} = 0 {]}
    \continue
\cycle{f s f \ell s\ell} &=& \cycle{???}
 \,,\qquad \mbox{shift} = ?
\,.
\eea
In other words, the 6 fundamental domain symbols are 3 rotations
$\{e,C_6,C_6^2\}$ together with 3 rotations followed by a reflection.

Cycles $\cycle{\ell f\ell}$,
$\cycle{\ell fs\ell}$,
\etc, are not distinct fixed points, because using cyclic symmetry and
$\ell^2 =1$ we have
 $\cycle{\ell f\ell}=\cycle{f}$,
$\cycle{\ell fs\ell}=\cycle{fs}$, \etc.


For practice, let's work out a
few  cycles composed of short flights only.
\refFig{7diskFundDflips2}: conversion of elementary cell \po s $\to$
fundamental domain fixed points for the short 2-cycle, 3-cycle and
6-cycle.
Adding long \po s and \rpo s should result in 11 fundamental domain fixed
points in all, and the 11 letters of alphabet of \refref{LorentzDiff}.

This is no new the 2-cycle:
$ \cycle{s \ell f \ell f \ell}
= \cycle{s f \ell f f \ell}
= \cycle{s f}
\neq \cycle{046\underline{10}}$,

There is also 2-cycle $\cycle{0369}$ (once we start including longs).

Though they have different number of flips, $f\ell f$ and $\ell f \ell$
will map the fundamental domain to the same copy, (see
\reffig{fig:symbolEquiv}).

A list of the shortest
equivalence relations, \ie, different sequences of operations reaching

I have checked a few cycles and their new symbolic representations. For
example, $\cycle{026}$ and \cycle{0260628}. For cycle $\cycle{026}$ and
$w=0.3$, \reffig{fig:cycle026}\,(left panel),
the symbolic sequence is $\cycle{f\ell sf\ell f fs}$.
% \item[2014-07-14 Predrag]
Using $f f = 1$
\[
\cycle{f\ell sf\ell f fs}
    = \cycle{f\ell sf\ell s}
    = \cycle{f\ell s}
\,.
\]
For $w=2.0$, \reffig{fig:cycle026}\,(right panel), the
sequence is slightly different, $f\ell s\ell f \ell fs$, but with the
equivalence relations
% $f \ell f=\ell f \ell$
% \item[2014-07-14 Predrag]
% You are sure that $f\ell f$ equals $\ell f \ell$?
% The have different numbers of flips.
$f s = s f$ and $f \ell f = \ell f \ell$ the end sequence is the
same,
\[
\cycle{f\ell s\ell f \ell fs}
    = \cycle{\ell s\ell f \ell s}
    = \cycle{\ell s f \ell f s}
    = \cycle{\ell s f}
\,.
\]

\item[2014-07-11 Tingnan]
Similar results can be obtained for $\cycle{0260628}$ in
\reffig{fig:cycle0260628}.
\[
\cycle{f \ell f s f \ell ...}
\,.
\]
(2014-07-14 Predrag: I give up, let computer do this...)
I have also
checked a few cases when long flights are involved, and the same
conclusion holds: the symbolic sequence we proposed is invariant to
parameter changes. I cannot mathematically prove it but I have some
interesting discovery: even if $w$ changes, the position of collision on
the circle always belongs to the same triangular piece (fundamental
domain). Any idea about this? If this is correct there must be something
very fundamental there. I will check the period-2 cycles proposed.

\item[2014-07-14 Predrag]
My intuition is that the symbolic dynamics is robust under varying
the disk spacing $w$ - for sufficiently large $w$ there is no pruning, and all
of our short/long hop orbits are allowed. As $w$ decreases, some of them get pruned,
but symbolic dynamics should not change - if you label disks, it labels the same
sequence of disk visitations (I do not how to prove this, so I might be wrong.)
It's not what we set out to do, but it is fun on its own,
and you \reffig{fig:cycle026} is a nice illustration; there seem to
be lots of equivalent sequences of three generators $\{s,\ell,f\}$ and
the problem is that of determining isomorphisms between deterministic
finite automata. One would like to somehow `quotient' equivalent
substrings. In general this might be a hard problem (Thurston worked on
it), but hopefully we can figure it out. We know that on the elementary
cell level there are only 11 (or 12 -  one isomorphism) symbols, so maybe
we can figure how to uniquely relabel the $\{s,\ell,f\}$ itineraries in
terms of such set.

\item[2014-07-14 Tingnan]
I think we should propose a separate label $\circ$ to indicate the
collision on the disk, i.e. $\cycle{\circ f}=\cycle{06}$. Without the
additional symbol, when we are doing the string reduction things could go
wrong.

The topological robustness of the cycle inspired me to look at the cycle
in fundamental domain from a different perspective. Before we write the
explicit symbol string using the 3 generators, let us just visualize a
flight between two nearest disk. I label the triangular pieces with
numbers, \reffig{fig:topoCombo}. A flight between two disk can be
represented by the combination of two labels (numbers). With symmetry
been considered, there are 12 topologically distinct combinations (out of
18 possible combinations):
\bea
1-1 & 1-1^\prime\continue
1-2 & 1-2^\prime\continue
1-3 & 1-3^\prime\continue
2-2 & 2-2^\prime\continue
2-3 & 2-3^\prime\continue
3-3 & 3-3^\prime
\eea
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{topologicalCombinationZoom}
\end{center}
\caption{Topological combination of fundamental domains.}
\label{fig:topoCombo}
\end{figure}
Now a fundamental domain fixed point should correspond to a symmetric (or
anti-symmetric) combination:
\bea
\cycle{f\circ} &= 1-1 &= \cycle{06}\continue
\cycle{sf\circ} &= 2-2^\prime &= \cycle{08}\continue
\cycle{\ell f\circ} &= 2-2 &= \cycle{048} \continue
\cycle{s\ell fs\ell\circ} &= 3-3^\prime &= \cycle{02}\continue
\cycle{s\ell f\ell\circ} &= 3-3 &= \cycle{0\underline{10}8642}\continue
\eea
The unknown fixed point then corresponds to $1-1^\prime$ which actually
degenerates with $1-1$. Though those orbits would fall at the boundary of
the fundamental domain, I choose the label such that the orbit minimize
the flight time between the labeled triangular pieces. Similarly we can
generate 12 possibilities for long flights.
