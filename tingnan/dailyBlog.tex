{\em Fractal diffusion coefficient from dynamical zeta functions}.

\item[2009-02-27 Predrag]
Read  Gilbert  and Lefevere\rf{GilbLef08},
    ``Heat conductivity from molecular chaos hypothesis
             in locally confined billiard systems,''

``From Deterministic Chaos to Deterministic Diffusion''
by R. Klages, \arXiv{0804.3068}: ``
A set of easy-to-read lecture notes for a short first-year Ph.D.
student course. The notes cover five hours of lectures and
do not require any prior knowledge on dynamical systems. The first part introduces
to deterministic chaos in one-dimensional maps in form of Lyapunov exponents
and the metric entropy. The second part first outlines the concept of
deterministic diffusion. Then the escape rate formalism for deterministic
diffusion, which expresses the diffusion coefficient in terms of the above two
chaos quantities, is worked out for a simple map. The notes conclude with a
very brief sketch of anomalous diffusion.

\item[2014-02-27 Predrag] Must read:
Dettmann\rf{Dettm14}, {\em Diffusion in the {Lorentz} gas}.

generate \texttt{f\_diff\_MarkPart.pdf}
from \texttt{.../xfig/f\_diff\_MarkPart.fig}

\item[2013-02-28 Predrag] to Tingnan Zhang:
Dettmann's review, \arXiv{1402.7010} is something that you want to read -
looks very complete. {\bf Goldman:} Sects. 7.4 and 7.5 and refs within
are tantalizing.

\item[2013-03-25 Predrag] to Tingnan Zhang:
{\em Superdiffusion in the periodic Lorentz gas} by
Jens Marklof and Balint Toth,  	\arXiv{1403.6024} is too mathematical and
general for our purposes (hopefully we will have no super-diffusivity, noise
should wipe that out), but
Sect.~2~{\em The scattering map} might be useful for your exposition
(or its prequel  \arXiv{0801.0612}).

\item[2014-04-18 Predrag]
Sinai\rf{Sinai04} might be a quick read.

Dresselhaus \etal\ textbook\rf{Dresselhaus07}
(\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/library/Dresselhaus07.pdf}{click here})
is good on discrete
and space (but not continuous) groups.
The MIT~course~6.734
\HREF{http://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/course/6/6.734j/www/group-full02.pdf}
{online version} contains much of the same material.

Chapter {\em 9. Space Groups in Real Space} is quite clear on matrix
representation of space groups. The translation group $T$ is a normal
subgroup of \Group\ and defines the Bravais lattice. The cosets by
translation $T$ (set all all group elements obtained by all translations)
form a factor group $\Group/T$, isomorphic to the point group $g$
(rotations). All irreducible representations of \Group\ can be compounded
from irreducible representations of $g$ and $T$.

Section {\em 9.3 Two-Dimensional Space Groups}: In the international
crystallographic notation, our hexagonal lattice \#17 is called $p6mm$,
with point group $6mm$.
\[
g = \{
E, C_6^+, C_6^-, C_3^+, C_3^-, C_2,
\sigma_{d1}, \sigma_{d2}, \sigma_{d3},
\sigma_{v1},\sigma_{v2}, \sigma_{v3}
\}
\]
Prefix $p$ indicates that the unit cell is primitive (not centered). This
is a simple or {\em symmorphic} group, which makes calculations easier.
The Bravais lattice is two equilateral triangles, not sure how to relate
it to our hexagonal `elementary cell'? A Brilloun zone? Bravais `unit cell'
is illustrated in Fig.~E.2. ChaosBook `Fundamental
domain' makes an appearance in Fig.~10.2.

The main trick in quantum-mechanical calculations is to go to the
\emph{reciprocal} space (see Fig.~E.2), in our case with the full
$\Gamma$ point, $k=0$, wave vector symmetry (see Table~10.1), and `Large
Representations'. This is something we have not tried in deriving the
trace formula for deterministic diffusion.

Sect. {\em 10.5 Characters for the Equivalence Representation} look
like those for the point group, sort of. We should probably work
out problems 10.1 and 10.2.

\item[2014-04-24 Tingnan]
Remember that some orbits that lie on the boundary of fundamental domain
have only 6 copies.

\item[2014-04-26 Predrag]
All divisors of 12 are possible multiplicites. The fully symmetric state
of multiplicity 1 would be an \eqv\ point at the origin: possible for
soft potentials but not for this billiard. Rest you can easily doodle if
you draw the hexagonal lattice (disks replaced by point): there is \po\
of length 6 (edges of the hexagon) of multiplicity 2 (the two
orientations of the orbit), and there should be orbits of multiplicity 3,
4, 6 and the generic asymmetric orbits of multiplicity 12.

\item[2014-04-24 Pavel]
Tingan and I have realized that in a
pseudo-cycle it is possible to have two or more prime cycles that differ
by a group action. In some sense, cross-terms still disappear, but it is
impossible to assign unique weights to each fundamental domain cycle.

\item[2014-04-26 Predrag to Tingan]
After the project is delivered,
have a look at
Knauf\rf{Knauf87,AschKnauf97},
{\em Ergodic and topological properties of {Coulombic} periodic potentials},
{\em Motion in periodic potentials},
Baldwin\rf{Baldwin88} {\em Soft billiard systems},
Kimball\rf{Kimball01}
{\em Chaotic properties of the soft-disk {Lorentz} gas},
B\'alint and T\'oth\rf{BaTo03,BaTo04}

{\em Mixing and its rate in `soft' and `hard' billiards
         motivated by the {Lorentz} process},
and
Elyutin\rf{Elyutin04}
{\em Lyapunov exponent for a gas of soft scatterers}.
Blog about relevant parts here, if there is something of interest
to us.

\item[2014-04-26 Predrag] We should read Chapter 7 of Gaspard\rf{PG97}.
Kimberly and I both have a hard copy. Gaspard discusses irreps of
the translation group in some detail.

\item[2014-04-26 Predrag]
I'm quite convinced that this problem is a solved problem, we just have
to understand how characters are used to project irreps of space groups.
One has to go to the reciprocal lattice, and utilize utilize the concept
of the `star'. All physical chemists and crystallographers know how to do
this - we just need to be good students and read the stuff. Our case is
the most symmetric, $p6mm$ lattice - it is surely worked out in some
paper in a way that we can understand. They call our `fundamental domain'
the `motif' or the `asymmetric unit'.

I found projects in \HREF{http://www-f1.ijs.si/~ziherl/SF.html} {this
course} easy to read, especially Toma\v{z} \v{C}endak, who reviews the
space groups theory in a pretty simple way, and Zavadlav has very pretty
wallpaper groups illustrations. Ziherl recommends Elliott and  Dawber,
{\em Symmetry in Physics}\rf{ELLIOTT}.

Joseph Sidighi likes Cotton\rf{Cotton08} {\em Chemical applications of
group theory}, which has no characters for space groups, but a very
pretty discussion of their geometry in Chapt.~11. Cotton was ``the most
influential inorganic chemist to ever have lived.''

You can write up the projects either together, starting with this file,
with all stuff that does not belong to the public version
bracketed by \texttt{ifboyscout}...\texttt{fi} . I think that would be a good
learning experience for both of you. Or separately, as two projects.
In that case, add them to this folder, \texttt{reducesymm/tingnan/} as
separate files. You can clip \& paste anything from here or from
ChaosBook.org, if that saves you LaTeXing time.

If we succeed in factorization, this would merit a publication.
It is OK if you do not succeed in factorization - I have failed myself, so
who am I to cast the first stone:)

\item[2014-05-02 Predrag]
Pavel again has an idea. Forget the translation group; tile every Lorentz
gas orbit by the little triangles (copies of the fundamental domain,
1/12th of the elementary cell). Then the group orbit is generated by 3
elements (ignoring going through the corners): go to the domain to the
left/right (generators of \Dn{12}) and flip the domain so it leaves the
elementary cell. To Predrag this is reminiscent of Penrose tailings,
where the space is tiled without the translations over square or cubic
lattice. For that, Mermin's article\rf{Mermin92} on space groups of
quasicrystals might be of interest.

I think the idea should be worked out in one dimension first, but Pavel
thinks that would be too simple. Predrag believes that you always work
out the simplest model first. $\ExpaEig =2$ vanishes by eq.~(25.20)
(\HREF{http://www.streamsound.dk/book1/chaos/chaos.html\#535/z} {click
here}), so the simplest diffusion models are for $\ExpaEig =3$ or $4$.
Reduce the map to the fundamental domain (positive 1/2 line) as in
ChaosBook fig.~9.8: The bimodal Ulam sawtooth map
(\HREF{http://www.streamsound.dk/book1/chaos/chaos.html\#186/z} {click
here}). That should give the symmetry-reduced symbolic dynamics, but the
group is larger than \Dn{1}, which works `within the elementary cell', by
generating the negative axis copy of the fundamental domain: one adds a
reflection that flips the flips the fundamental domain (the half-unit
interval) outside of the elementary cell, to the adjoining tile (the
second one to the left or the right. This operation generates the
translations, and together the two group operations assign a symbolic
itinerary to any orbit. Then one should find the rule that reads of the
global translation from the symbolic itinerary, insert this into the
cycle expansions for the deterministic diffusion formula.

For $\ExpaEig =2$ I get that the fundamental domain dynamics is given by
the full tent map
(\HREF{http://www.streamsound.dk/book1/chaos/chaos.html\#244/z} {click
here}), so it cannot be simpler. Too bad that $D=0$ identically :)

\item[2014-05-03 Predrag] I drew by hand the $\Dn{1}$ reduction of the
dynamics to the fundamental domain for $\ExpaEig =3$ case - it is really
simple and it works. Guys, try it, then try it for the Lorenz gas. I'm
optimistic.

\item[2014-05-03 Predrag] Pavel is right - 1D case is probably
misleading, I used only translations to find the global displacement.
With reflections, the distances on the 2D lattice corresponding to
relative prime cycles will not be integer vectors - their construction
will resemble what we do when we bounce a straight trajectory off a
sequence of 3-disks, it will be a computation, and go to the new
`comoving' coordinate frame. But a doable one. Maybe one should play with
the least symmetric triangular $p3$ ($\Zn{3}$ point group) tiling first,
rather than with the most symmetric hexagonal $p6mm$ lattice ($\Dn{6}$
point group).

\item[2014-05-05 Tingnan] My numbers of elementary cell prime cycles,
Lyapunov exponents and diffusion coefficients are listed and compared
to the Schreiber calculation in \reftab{TCELL}. I still have the problem
for the convergence of diffusion coefficients. Did we miss a factor of 2
somewhere?

Note that while Tingnan more prime periodic orbits than Thomas Schreiber,
convergence is not improved. To the contrary: the diffusion constant and
the Lyapunov exponent of \reftab{TCELL} do not agree for even $\cl{}=2$,
so something is seriously amiss. It is unlikely that Thomas and
I would have gotten that wrong. Have to

I created a sketch of \reffig{diskLabelsElCell} which should explain step
by step how one goes from absolute labeling of disks on the infinite
hexagonal lattice to the translation-quotiented elementary cell, step by
step. Please generate this in Matlab, but with resulting figures as here
(small disks, no axes, etc.). What made the file so big (my
\texttt{*.svg} is 10 times smaller) were the fat red circles, which were
raster rather than vector graphics - replace them in Matlab code with a
thin line circle, hopefully that will be drawn in the vector format, so I
do not have to manually clean them up in \texttt{Inkscape}.

We also need to create our own version of Fig.~4 of \refref{CGS92}.

\item[2014-05-20 Predrag]
Elementary cell symbolic dynamics labels are not disk labels, but rather
the labels of transitions between disks along the 12 translational
vectors. Hence I am experimenting with replacing
\reffig{diskLabelsElCell} by \reffig{diskDirectionsElCell}, labeling the
translation vectors connecting the center of the current disk to the
center of the next disk. Do you think it is easier to understand the
symbolic dynamics this way?

\item[2014-05-21 Tingnan]
I think it is clearer in this way. BTW I migrated my code base to cpp for faster computing speed (in order to find periodic orbits of topological length 8). I will try both derivative-free (Nelder-Mead) routine as well as those methods based on derivatives. The multi-dimensional flight time function (to be minimized) seems to have a quite complex landscape which creates a lot of numerical difficulties. Do you know which references have figures/tables showing the diffusion coefficient/flight time/etc as a function of some parameters? Insofar I can only find estimations on hard disks as a function of disk separation $w$. I am looking at this because Dan would like to see the parameter variations and their effects, from an experimental aspect.
