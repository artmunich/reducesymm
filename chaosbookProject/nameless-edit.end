\@doendnote{endnote10}{PC: A bit more sutle ; They are ``slaved'', meaning that their dynamics is completely determined by the finite set of low wavenumber components.}
\@doendnote{endnote11}{PC: as $\Lambda _1<0$ this covers both parts of the unstable manifold, but in general you need both signs of $\lambda _i$.\\ ES: I don't restrict $\lambda _i$ to be positive and in practice I use both signs. If only one sign were used, then at each iteration we would get points in a different side of the manifold around $x_o$. }
\@doendnote{endnote12}{ PC: You call $\protect \mathaccentV {hat}05E{j}_1$ $\protect \mathaccentV {hat}05E{e}_1$ later on. Probably need to say $\left |\protect \mathaccentV {hat}05E{j}_1\right |=1$, so ``small $\lambda _i$'' is more precise.\\ ES: I use $\protect \mathaccentV {hat}05E{e}_i$ for the unstable eigenvectors, while $\protect \mathaccentV {hat}05E{j}_1$ is the projection of $\protect \mathaccentV {hat}05E{e}_1$ on the Poincar\'e section (I consider it normalized again, but even if it is not, then $\left | j_1 \right | \leq 1$ ). I think that $\protect \mathaccentV {hat}05E{e}_1$ does not lie on the Poincar\'e section, so it is not the same as $\protect \mathaccentV {hat}05E{j}_1$. The ``hat'' notation means unit vector anyway.}
\@doendnote{endnote13}{PC: more subtle; forward images of the nearest pair of turning points get sharper and sharper, with $\kappa \rightarrow \infty $ for higher and higher iterates. }
\@doendnote{endnote14}{I have done it by determining the offset graphically. To set $s=0$ exactly on $x_o$ requires some more thinking, so I will do it later.}
\@doendnote{endnote15}{PC: This subsection could be made much shorter with no loss of pedagogy.\\ ES: I can't decide if I should make it shorter or not include it at all. }
\@doendnote{endnote16}{PC: first return to the Poincar\'e section?}
