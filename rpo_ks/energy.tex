%   As nobody else deigns to do it, I picked the low fruit that I have
%been talking about past month: defined the
Power input {\em vs.} energy
dissipation rates for Kuramoto-Sivashinsky: I cannot believe that it is
not in the literature, it is standard energy balance exercise for Navier
Stokes case.
This should show the isolated equilibria far from the
chaotic measures, and the important rpos well embedded in it. More
importantly,
If Loss gives us Sobolev bounds on energy, we might be able
to bound the number of equilibria as function of systems size L, and thus
be sure we have them all.

The {space average} of a function $\obser = \obser(\pSpace,t)$ defined on
the interval $L$ is given by the integral
\beq
    \expct{\obser} = \frac{1}{L}\int_0^{L} d\pSpace\, \obser(\pSpace,t)
    \,.
    \label{rpo:spac_ave}
\eeq
$\expct{\obser}$ is in general time dependent. 
Its mean value is given by the {time average}
\beq
\timeAver{\obser}
    =
\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} {1\over t} \int_0^t \! d\tau \, \expct{\obser}
    =
\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} {1\over t L} \int_0^t \! 
    \int_0^{L} \! d\tau \, d\pSpace\, \obser(\pSpace,\tau)
    \,.
\label{rpo:tim_ave}
\eeq
The mean value
$\timeAver{\obser}$ takes a particularly simple form when
evaluated on an
\eqv\ or {\reqv} $u(\pSpace,t) = u_q(\pSpace-ct)$
\beq
         \obser_q = \expct{\obser}_q
\,,
\label{rpo:u-eqv}
\eeq
Evaluation of the infinite time average \refeq{rpo:tim_ave}
on a function of a \po\ or \rpo\ $u_p(\pSpace,t)$
 requires only a single traversal of the periodic solution,
\beq
       \obser_p = \frac{1}{\period{p}}
    \int_0^{\period{p}} \! d\tau \, \expct{\obser}
\,,
\label{rpo:u-cyc}
\eeq
where $\period{p}$ is the period.
$\obser_p$ is a loop integral
along a single parcourse of a prime cycle $p$.
%  so it is an intrinsic property of the periodic solution.

Take time derivative of the energy density \refeq{ksEnergy},
substitute \refeq{ks} and integrate by parts. Total derivatives vanish
by the spatial periodicity on the $L$ domain:
\bea
   \frac{1}{2}\dot{\expctE} &=&
     \expct{u \, u_t}
    % \frac{1}{L}\int_0^{L}u \, u_t\, dx
     = \expct{u (u^2 - u \, u_{x} - u \, u_{xxx})_x}
    \continue
    &=&
\expct{ - u_x \, u^2 + (u_{x})^2 + u_x \, u_{xxx}}
    \,.
\label{rpo:ksErate}
\eea
For an equilibrium it follows from \refeq{KSeqvCond}
that $\expctE$ is constant, as it should be:
\[
   \frac{1}{2}\dot{\expctE} =
\expct{ (-u^2 + u_{x} + u_{xxx}) \,u_x}
    = - \expctE \expct{ u_x }=0
    \,.
\]
The first term in \refeq{rpo:ksErate} vanishes by
integration by parts,
\beq
 \expct{(u^3)_x} = 3 \expct{ u_x \, u^2}=0
\,,
\ee{EnNonl0}
and integrating the third term by parts yet again we get
that the energy variation\rf{ksgreene88}
% \PC{this is ``power", nicht war?}
\beq
   \frac{1}{2}\dot{\expctE} =
      \expct{(u_{x})^2} - \expct{(u_{xx})^2}
\ee{EnRate}
balances the KS equation \refeq{ks} power pumped in by the anti-diffusion
$u_{xx}$
against energy dissipated by the hypervicosity $u_{xxxx}$.

The time averaged energy density  $\timeAver{E}$
computed on a typical orbit goes to a constant, so
the expectation values \refeq{rpo:EtimAve} of drive and dissipation
exactly balance each out:
\beq
    \timeAver{\dot{E}}  =
    \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}
        {1\over t} \int_0^t d\tau \, \dot{\expctE}
=
      \timeAver{(u_{x})^2} - \timeAver{(u_{xx})^2}
= 0
    \,.
\ee{rpo:EtimAve}
In particular, the \eqva\
and \reqva\ sit on the diagonal in \reffig{f:drivedrag},
and so do time averages computed on \po s and \rpo s:
\bea
\timeAver{E}_p &=&
{1\over \period{p}} \int_0^\period{p}d\tau \, \expctE(\tau)
    \continue
\timeAver{(u_{x})^2}_p &=&
{1\over \period{p}} \int_0^\period{p} d\tau \, \expct{(u_{x})^2}
    =
      \timeAver{(u_{xx})^2}_p
    \,.
\label{poE}
\eea

In the Fourier basis \refeq{EFourier} the conservation of energy on average
takes form
\beq
0 = \sum_{k=1}^{+\infty} ( (k/\tildeL)^2 - ( k/\tildeL)^4 )\,
    \timeAver{E_k}
\,,\qquad
E_k(t) =  |a_k(t)|^2
\,.
\ee{EFourier1}
The large $k$ convergence of this series is insensitive to the
system size \tildeL; $\timeAver{E_k}$ have to decrease much faster than
$1/( k/\tildeL)^4$.
\PC{determine the decay rate, presumably exponential in $k$}
Deviation of $E_k$ from this bound for small $k$ determines the active modes.
This should be particularly useful to bound the number of equilibria, with
the upper bound given by zeros of a small number
of long wavelength modes.

\PC{Past: Michael Loss has not taught us how to bound $E$ by
    Sobolev bounds. Neither has Spiegel. Next: But Constantin says that the answer is in
    \refrefs{temam85ks}. For steady solutions there is $L$-independent bound
    in \refref{Mks86}. Eckmann: the  best bound is by Otto\cite{GiacoOtto05}; the
    only bound close to k=0, better in essential way. See also \refref{bronski-2005}.
    Eckmann had $L^{8/5}$, but conceptually Otto is the best.
    When the solution is big, how long can it stay big? They found it cannot stay big for
    long.
