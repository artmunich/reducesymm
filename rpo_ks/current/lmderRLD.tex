\section{Levenberg--Marquardt searches for \rpo s}
\label{sec:lmderRLD}

To find \rpo s of the \KSe , we use multiple shooting and
the Levenberg--Marquardt (LM) algorithm implemented in the routine
{\tt lmder} from the MINPACK software package\rf{minpack}.
% or function {\tt fsolve} in Matlab.

In order to find periodic orbits, a system of nonlinear
algebraic equations needs to be solved.  For flows, this
system is underdetermined, so, traditionally, it is augmented with
a constraint that restricts the search space to be transversal to the
flow (otherwise, most of the popular solvers of systems of nonlinear
algebraic equations, e.g. those based on Newton's method, cannot be used).
When detecting \rpo s, more constraints are added for each of the continuous
symmetries present in their definition.  For example, when detecting
relative periodic orbits in the complex Ginzburg–Landau equation (CGLE),
L{\'o}pez {\etal}\rf{lop05rel} introduce three additional constraints.

Our approach differs from those used previously in that we do not
introduce the constraints.  Note that, being an optimization solver,
the LM algorithm has no problem with solving an underdetermined systems of
equations, and, even though {\tt lmder} explicitly restricts the
number of equations to be not smaller than the number of variables,
the additional equations can be set identically equal to
zero\rf{Crofts07thesis}.  In fact, there is numerical evidence
that, when implemented with additional constraints, the
solver usually takes more steps to converge from the same seed,
or fails to converge at all\rf{Crofts07thesis}.

Below we give a detailed description of the algorithm and the
search strategy which we have used to find a large number
of \rpo s (RPOs) defined in \refeq{KSrpos} and pre-periodic orbits (PPOs)
defined in \refeq{KSpos}.

When searching for RPOs of the truncated \KSe\
(see \refeq{eq:KS}), we need to solve the system of $N-2$ equations
\beq
  {\bf g}(\shift)f^\period{}(a) - a = 0\,,
\ee{eq:system}
with $N$ unknowns $(a, \period{}, \shift)$, where $f^t$
is the flow map of the \KSe.  In the case of PPOs, the system has
the form
\beq
  -{\bf g}(-\shift)[f^\period{}(a)]^\ast - a = 0\,,
\ee{eq:systemppos}
(see \refeq{KSposFour}).

We have tried two different implementations of the multiple shooting.
The emphasis was on the simplicity of the implementations, so, even
though both implementations worked equally well, each of them had
its own minor drawbacks.

In the first implementation, we fix the total number of steps within
each shooting stage and change the numerical integrator step size
$h$ in order to adjust the total integration time to a desired value
$\period{}$.

Let $(\hat{a}, \hat{\period{}}, \hat{\shift})$ be the starting guess for a \rpo\
obtained through a close return within a chaotic attractor (see below).
We require that the initial integration step size
does not exceed $h_0$, so we round off the
number of integration steps to $n = \lceil \hat{\period{}}/h_0\rceil$, where
$\lceil x \rceil$ denotes the nearest integer larger than $x$.

The integration step size is equal to $h = \period{}/n$. With the
number of shooting stages equal to $m$, the system in
\refeq{eq:system} is rewritten as follows
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:MultShoot}
 F^{(1)}&\!=\!& f^\tau(a^{(1)}) - a^{(2)} = 0\,,\nonumber\\
 F^{(2)}&\!=\!& f^\tau(a^{(2)}) - a^{(3)} = 0\,,\nonumber\\
 && \cdots \\
 F^{(m-1)}&\!=\!& f^\tau(a^{(m-1)}) - a^{(m)} = 0\,,\nonumber\\
 F^{(m)}&\!=\!& {\bf g}(\shift)f^{\tau'}(a^{(m)}) - a^{(1)} = 0\,,\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $\tau = \lfloor n/m \rfloor h$ ($\lfloor x \rfloor$ is the nearest
integer smaller than $x$),
$\tau' = nh - (m-1)\tau$, and $a^{(j)} = f^{(j-1)\tau}(a)$, 
$j = 1, \ldots , m$.  For the detection of PPOs, the last equation
in \refeq{eq:MultShoot} should be replaced with
\[
 F^{(m)} = -{\bf g}(-\shift)[f^{\tau'}(a^{(m)})]^\ast - a^{(1)} = 0\,.
\]
With the Jacobian matrix of \refeq{eq:MultShoot} written as
\beq
  J = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}\!\!
   \displaystyle \frac{\partial F^{(j)}}{\partial a^{(k)}} &
   \displaystyle \frac{\partial F^{(j)}}{\partial \period{}} &
   \displaystyle \frac{\partial F^{(j)}}{\partial \shift}\!\!
  \end{array}\right),\quad j,k = 1,\ldots,m\,,
\eeq
the partial derivatives with respect to $a^{(k)}$ can be calculated
using the solution of \refeq{eq:KStan} as described in
Appendix~\ref{sec:stability}.  The partial derivatives
with respect to $T$ are given by
\beq
  \frac{\partial F^{(j)}}{\partial \period{}} =
  \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
    \frac{\partial f^\tau(a^{(j)})}{\partial \tau}
    \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial T} = v(f^\tau(a^{(j)}))
    \lfloor n/m \rfloor/n\,, & j = 1,\ldots, m-1\\[.5ex]
    {\bf g}(\shift) v(f^{\tau'}(a^{(j)}))
    (1 - \frac{m-1}{n} \lfloor n/m \rfloor ), & j = m\,.
  \end{array}\right.
\eeq
Note that, even though $\partial f^t(a) /\partial t = v(f^t(a))$,
it should not be evaluated using equation for the vector field.
The reason is that, since the flow $f^t$ is approximated by a
numerical solution, the derivative of the numerical solution with
respect to the step size $h$ may differ from the vector field $v$,
especially for larger step sizes.  We evaluate the derivative by
a forward difference using numerical integration with step sizes
$h$ and $h + \delta$:
\beq
  \frac{\partial f^{jh}(a)}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{j\delta}
  \left[f^{j(h+\delta)}(a) - f^{jh}(a)\right],\quad j \in
  {\mathbb Z}^{+}
\eeq with $t = jh$ and $\delta = 10^{-7}$ for double precision
calculations. Partial derivatives $\partial F^{(j)}/\partial \shift$
are all equal to zero except for $j = m$, where it is given by
\beq
  \frac{\partial F^{(m)}}{\partial \shift} =
  \frac{d{\bf g}}{d\shift}f^{\tau'}(a^{(m)}) =
  \diag(i q_k e^{i q_k\, \shift} )f^{\tau'}(a^{(m)})\,.
\eeq

This Jacobian is supplied to {\tt lmder}
augmented with two rows of zeros corresponding to the two identical
zeros augmenting \refeq{eq:MultShoot} in order to make the number of
equations formally equal to the number of variables,
as discussed above.

In the second implementation, we keep $h$ and $\tau$ fixed and vary
only $\tau' = \period{} - (m-1)\tau$.  In this case, we need to be
able to determine the numerical solution of \KSe\ not only at times
$t_j = jh, j = 1, 2, \ldots$, but at any intermediate time as well.
We do this by a cubic polynomial interpolation through points
$f^{t_j}(a)$ and $f^{t_{j+1}}(a)$ with slopes $v(f^{t_j}(a))$ and
$v(f^{t_{j+1}}(a))$.  The difference from the first implementation
is that partial derivatives $\partial F^{(j)}/\partial \period{}$
are zero for all $j = 1,\ldots,m-1$, except for
\beq
  \frac{\partial F^{(m)}}{\partial \period{}} =
  {\bf g}(\shift)v(f^{\tau'}(a^{(m)}))\,.
\eeq
which, for consistency, needs to be evaluated from the cubic
polynomial, not from the flow equation evaluated
at $f^{\tau'}(a^{(m)})$.

For detecting \rpo s of the \KSe\ with $L = 22$, we used
$N = 32$, $h = 0.25$ (or $h_0 = 0.25$ within the first implementation),
and the number of shooting stages such that $\tau \approx 40.0$.
While both implementations were equally successful in detecting
periodic orbits of \KSe , we found the second implementation more
convenient.

The following search strategy was adopted: The search for \rpo s with
$\period{} \in [10, 200]$ was conducted within a rectangular region
containing the chaotic attractor.  To generate a seed, a random point was
selected within the region and the flow \refeq{eq:KS} was
integrated for a transient time $t = 40$, sufficient for an orbit
to settle on the attractor at some point $\hat{a}$.  This point was taken
to be the seed location.  In order to find orbits with different
periods, the time interval $[10, 200]$ was subdivided into windows
of length 10, i.e. $[t_\mathrm{min}, t_\mathrm{max}]$, where
$t_\mathrm{min} = 10j$ and $t_\mathrm{max} = 10(j+1)$, with
$j = 1, 2, \ldots, 19$.  To determine the seed time
$\hat{\period{}}$ and shift $\hat{\shift}$, we located an
approximate global minimum of $\| \pm{\bf g}(\pm\shift)f^t(a) - a \|$ as
a function of $t \in [t_\mathrm{min}, t_\mathrm{max}]$ and
$\shift \in (-L/2, L/2]$.  We did this simply by finding the minimum
value of the function on a grid of points with resolution $h$
in time and $L/50$ in $\shift$.

Once a \rpo\ is found, its existence in the \KS\ PDE is verified
 numerical approximation improved by increasing the number of
Fourier modes ($N = 64$) and reducing the step size ($h = 0.1$).
    \edit{
Among the thousands of orbits
computed in this study only two failed this higher-resolution test.
