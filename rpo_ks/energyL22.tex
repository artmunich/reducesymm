Projections
from the $\infty$-dimensional \statesp\ onto
the 3-dimensional
$(E,P,D)$ representation of the flow, such as
\reffigs{f:drivedrag}{f:drivedragConn},
can be misleading.
For example, the energy of \reqva\ \REQV{\pm}{2} which
seems close to the
mean turbulent energy in \reffig{f:drivedrag} is separated
from it when plotted along the
$\expct{u \, u_{x}{}^2}$ moment, where according to
\refeq{Bridges1} it takes nonzero value $c P$.
Another example is the \rpo\ $(\period{p},\shift_p) =(32.8,10.96)$
which appears well embedded within the turbulent flow.
The mean value of $\timeAver{P_p}$
evaluated on it,
\reffig{f:ks22rposShort}\,(\textit{c}),
is quite close to the long-time turbulent
time average $\timeAver{P}$.
Similarly close prediction of mean dissipation rate in the
\pCf\ from a single-period \po\ computed by
Kawahara and Kida\rf{KawKida01} has lead to
optimistic hopes that ``turbulence" is different from
low-dimensional chaos, insofar that the determination of one
magic \po\ could yield all long-time predicitions.
Regrettably, not true - as always, here too one needs a hierarchy
of \po s of increasing length to obtain accurate
predictions\rf{DasBuch}.

The most one can say is that if points are clearly separated in an
$(E,P,D)$ plot (for example, in \reffig{f:ks22rposShort}
$\EQV{1}$ \eqv\ is not part of the recurrent set), they are also separated
in the full \statesp. Converse is not true - states of
very different topology can have similar energies.
