In \reffig{f:drivedrag}
we plot \refeq{EnRate}, the time-dependent $\dot{\expctE}$
in the
power input $P$ {\em vs.} %$\expct{u_{x}{}^2}$ vs.
dissipation rate $D$ %$\expct{u_{xx}{}^2}$
plane, for all $L=22$ \eqva\ and
\reqva\ \PCedit{determined so far},
several \po s and \rpo s, and for a typical `turbulent'
long-time trajectory.
\PC{\reffig{f:drivedrag}:
%    (0) replace $y$-axis by
%    $\expct{(u_{xx})^2}-\expct{(u_{x})^2}$, so all \po s lie
%    on the $x$-axis and on can see more clearly the turbulent and
%    periodic trajectory, instead having them scrunched into the
%    diagonal. (a) Replace by side views of
%    3-$d$ $(\expct{u^2},\expct{(u_{x})^2},\expct{(u_{xx})^2}
%       -\expct{(u_{x})^2})$,
%    two figures;
    (b) current type figure, with chaotic trajectory,
    all \eqva, $(32.\cdots,11)$ as example of well embedded, and
    a typical \po\ {\em not} embedded into the `turbulent' attractor.
    (c) a separate figure with more \po s, no `turbulent' attractor.
%    (d) prepare a mathematica macro that automatically uses
%    fonts at least twice the size you use currently.
    (e) replace
    gray window with a white background, black font. (f) in the
    publication version replace colored dots with symbols of varying
    shapes, fine black border, can be filled in with colors.

Projections
from the $\infty$-dimensional \statesp\ onto
the 3-dimensional
$(E,P,D)$ representation of the flow, such as
\reffigs{f:drivedrag}{f:drivedragConn},
can be misleading.
Another example is the \rpo\ $(\period{p},\shift_p) =(32.8,10.96)$
which appears well embedded within the turbulent flow.
The mean value of $\timeAver{P_p}$
evaluated on it,
\reffig{f:ks22rposShort}\,(\textit{c}),
is quite close to the long-time turbulent
time average $\timeAver{P}$.
Similarly close prediction of mean dissipation rate in the
\pCf\ from a single-period \po\ computed by
Kawahara and Kida\rf{KawKida01} has lead to
optimistic hopes that `turbulence' is different from
low-dimensional chaos, insofar that the determination of one
magic \po\ could yield all long-time predications.
Regrettably, not true - as always, here too one needs a hierarchy
of \po s of increasing length to obtain accurate
predictions\rf{DasBuch}.

The most one can say is that if points are clearly separated in an
$(E,P,D)$ plot (for example, in \reffig{f:ks22rposShort}
$\EQV{1}$ \eqv\ is not part of the recurrent set), they are also separated
in the full \statesp. Converse is not true - states of
very different topology can have similar energies.
