\section{\KS steady-state bifurcations}
\label{sec:KSlit}

\subsection{\Eqva\ according to Greene and Kim}

\KSE\ steady state bifurcations are well studied, see for example Greene and Kim\rf{ksgreene88} and
Kevrekidis, Nicolaenko and Scovel \ref{KNSks90}. 

For small $\alpha$ the only \eqv\ of the system is the constant solution $y(x,t)=0$,
which is globally attracting 
for $\tildeL=\sqrt{\alpha}/2<1$. At $\tildeL=N$, with $N$ integer, 
the $N$th harmonic becomes unstable and the constant solution
bifurcates to the so called $N$-cell states. 
As shown in \refref{ksgreene88} these states contain only the multiples of the $N$th
harmonic, {\ie} only the components $a_N,a_{2N},...$ in our notation.
Moreover, the $N$-cell states are found to be antisymmetric (in our form of \KSe).
Greene and Kim show that symmetric solutions are \eqva, not \reqva. 
At point $A$ in \reffig{fig:GreeneKim} the $1$-cell state loses stability
and bifurcates to a stable, 
asymmetric \reqv, which later on becomes unstable through a Hopf bifurcation. 

At $\tildeL=2$ the system has become large enough that a $2$-cell \eqv\ appears. At point $B$
in \reffig{fig:GreeneKim} the $1$-cell branch merges to the $2$-cell branch. In general each $N$-cell branch merges to the corresponding $2N$-cell branch.

At point $C$ in \reffig{fig:GreeneKim} the $2$-cell state bifurcates to a type of 
\eqv\ solution
found by La Quey, Mahajan, Rutherford and Tang\rf{laquey74} and generalized by Greene and Kim who refer to them as GLMRT \eqva. GLMRT solutions are symmetric 
($u(x)$ is antisymmetric)
and can be roughly described as long-wave distorted $N$-cell states.

% The last type of solution identified in \refref{ksgreene88} appears at point $F$ 
% in \reffig{fig:GreeneKim} and is called a
% ``giant" state because its amplitude grows as the system size increases.

According to the bifurcation diagram \reffig{fig:GreeneKim}, 
at the point that corresponds to system size $\tildeL=\alpha^{1/2}/2\simeq3.5$
studied here,
the {\eqva} we expect are the $2$- and $3$-cell states ($\EQV{2}$ and $\EQV{3}$ respectivelly), the GLMRT state that bifurcates from a $3$-cell state at point $I$ ($\EQV{1}$),
the \reqva\ that belong to the branches starting at points $A$ ($\REQV{\pm}{1}$),
and $M$ ($\REQV(\pm){2}$).


In \reffig{fig:GreeneKim} \ the ``elastic energy'' reads:
\beq
    \tilde{E}=\frac{1}{L}\int_0^{L}\tilde{u}^2\, d\tilde{x}\,.
\eeq

\subsection{Back in the saddle again}

Kevrekidis, Nicolaenko and Scovel~\rf{KNSks90} study \KSe\ steady state 
bifurcations and the role of symmetry in the existance of structurally stable (relative) homoclinic and heteroclinic connections between unstable saddles. The form  of the equation they use is
essentially that of Greene and Kim but with bifurcation parameter connected to our by $\alpha=4\tilde{L}^2$.


They prove that the bifurcation of the trivial state $y=0$ to an $N$-cell state is a pitchfork. 
They observe that when the $1$-cell state losses stability at point $A$ the
eigenvector corresponding to the zero eigenvalue of the stability matrix aligns itself with the direction of uniform translation of the
system which, due to the translational invariance of \KSe\, also corresponds to a zero eigenvalue. Thus the algebraic multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue is $2$ while its geometric multiplicity is $1$. Using this fact and a local, $O(2)$-equivariant, approximation to the center manifold they prove that this type of bifurcation creates traveling waves.

In typical numerical simulations  a trajectory initiated along the (single) unstable eigendirection of a
fixed point $y$ of the $2$-cell branch would eventually become attracted to the $L/4$-translated equilibrium $y'$. 
Those (relative) homoclinic connections 
\ES{In \refref{KNSks90} the characterization homoclinic connection is used. Here
we prefer (to invent?) the term relative homoclinic to emphasize the fact that the fixed points are symmetry related.} although structurally unstable in most dynamical systems, were found to be persistent in KSe with the afore-mentioned behaviour observed in the range  
from $\tilde{L}\simeq 2.009$ up to $\tilde{L}\simeq 2.375$  where the $2$-cell state becomes stable. The existance and
robustness of the saddle connection was explained as follows\ES{The following may not make perfect sense without reading the paper, especially the
notation. I've start re-writing \KS\ symmetries section to incorporate information about the invariant subspaces which hopefully will explain it but
my progress is very slow.}:  The unstable manifold of $y$ lies on an invariant subspace $L$ of
\KS\ flow, which is the fixed set of the isotropy subgroup of $O(2)$ defined by reflection with respect to imaginary axis. The action of the generator of $D(4)$ (which sents y to y') on $L$ is to send it to the invariant subspace $R_{1}$ which is the fixed set of $Z(2)$ defined by complex
conjugation. The converse is also true, i.e. the action of $D(4)$ sents $R_{1}$ to $L$. Thus the unstable eigendirection of $y$, lying on $L$, is sent on $R_{1}$ for the $L/4$-shifted point $y'$. The two invariant subspaces $L$ and $R_{1}$ are orthogonal and thus the point $y'$ has only stable eigendirections on $L$ and appears as a sink on that subspace. This explains why the (relative) homoclinic connections are structurally stable in \KSe.

In the range $\tilde{L}=2.00$ when the $2$-cell branch comes to existance with two unstable eigendirections, up to $\tilde{L} \simeq 2.009$ when it
merges to the $1$-cell branch and losses one of its unstable eigendirections, a heteroclinic loop exists that connects $2$-cell to $1$-cell solutions.
The analysis is similar to the previous case.

An important remark in \refref{KNSks90} is that the exact saddle connections were observed using a numerical integrator based on an explicit Galerkin spectral discretezation of \KSe, irrespective of how close to the equilibrium along the unstable manifold we start. On the contrary, when an FFT-based integrator was used, trajectories with initial condition along the unstable direction of $y$ would approach the homoclinic connection but fly away along the direction of the unstable manifold of $y'$ and follow an approximate (relative) homoclinic loop. This is attributed to the Galerkin truncation respecting the symmetries and possesing the same subspaces as the original equation restricted to the first $n$ modes \ES{We observe the second kind of behavour and we both use an FFT based integrator. I plan to quikly write a Galerkin integrator and check to see if we get an exact connection.}.
