% \label{sec:L22}
% Predrag created file              jul  9 2006

We now turn to exploring Hopf's vision
numerically, on a specific \KS\ system.
An instructive example is offered by the dynamics for
the  $L=22$  system
that we specialize to for the rest of this paper.
The size of this
small system is $\sim 2.5$ mean wavelengths
($\tildeL/\sqrt{2}= 2.4758$),
    \PC{define this $\sqrt{2}$ in the theory
        section, refer to it here
        }
and the competition between wavenumbers 2 and 3 states
leads to the empirically observed `sustained turbulence.'
Asymptotic attractor structure of small systems like
the one studied here
is very sensitive to system parameter variations, and,
as is true of
any realistic unsteady flow, there is no rigorous way of
establishing that this `turbulence' is sustained for all time,
rather than being
merely a very long transient on a way to an
attracting periodic state.
For large system size, as the one shown in \reffig{f:ks_largeL}, it is
hard to imagine a scenario under which attractive periodic states
(as shown in \refref{FSTks86} they do exist) would have significantly
large immediate basins of attraction.
Regardless of the
(non)existence of a $t \to \infty$ chaotic attractor, study
of the invariant unstable solutions and the associated Smale
horseshoe structures in system's \statesp\ offers valuable
insights into the observed unstable `coherent structures.'

Because of the strong $k^4$ contraction, for a small system size
one expects that the long-time dynamics is confined to low-dimensional
center manifold. Indeed, numerically the leading Lyapunov exponents of the
$L=22$ chaotic attractor are
$(\Lyap_i) = (0.048, 0, 0, -0.003, -0.189, -0.256, -0.290, \cdots)$,
so the chaotic dynamics mostly takes
place close to a 4-dimensional manifold, with strong
contraction in other dimensions.  The two zero exponents
are due to the
time and space translational symmetries of the \KSe,
and it was shown in \refrefs{Christiansen:97,LanCvi07}
that within particular curvilinear coordinate frames, the
dynamics on the attractor can sometimes be reduced to
local 1- or 2-dimensional maps.
Hence a relatively small
number of Fourier modes truncations, of order of $d \sim 10^2$
for the system studied here, suffices to obtain
numerically accurate (within $10^{-5}$) invariant
solutions.

We next investigate the properties of \eqva\ and \reqva\ and a large set
of the short periods \rpo s for KS in a periodic cell of
size $L=22$.

\section{\Eqva\ and \reqva for L=22}

In addition to the trivial \eqv\ $u=0$ (denoted \EQV{0}),
we find three \eqva\ with dominant wavenumber $k$
(denoted \EQV{k}) for $k = 1, 2, 3$.  All {\eqva}, shown in
Fig.~\ref{f:KS22Equil}, are symmetric with respect to the reflection
symmetry \refeq{KSparity}.
In addition, \EQV{2} and \EQV{3} are symmetric with respect
to translation \refeq{KSshift}, by $L/2$ and $L/3$, respectively.
\EQV{2} and \EQV{3} essentially lie, respectively, in
the 2$^\mathrm{nd}$ and 3$^\mathrm{rd}$ Fourier component complex plane,
with small deformations from \ESedit{$k=2j$, $k=3j$} harmonics.

The stability of the {\eqva} is characterized by the eigenvalues
$\eigExp[j]$ of the \stabmat.  The leading 10 eigenvalues for each
\eqv\ are listed in \reftab{tab:Eksym}. We compute (available upon request)
the corresponding eigenvectors as well. As an \eqv\ with $\mathrm{Re}
\lambda_j > 0$ is unstable in the direction of the corresponding
eigenvector $\jEigvec{j}$, the eigenvectors provide flow-intrinsic
(PDE discretization independent) coordinates which we use for visualization
of unstable manifolds and homo- / hetero-clinic connections between
\eqva.

The eigenvalues of \EQV{0} are determined by the linear part of the KS
equation \refeq{expanMvar}: $\lambda_k=(k/\tilde{L})^2-(k/\tilde{L})^4$.
For $L=22$, there are three pairs of unstable eigenvalues, corresponding,
in decreasing order, to three unstable modes $k=2,3$, and 1.  For each
mode, the corresponding eigenvectors lie in the plane spanned by
$\Re \, a_k$ and $\Im \, a_k$. \refTab{tab:Eksym}
lists the symmetries of the stability eigenvectors of
\eqva\ \EQV{1} to \EQV{3}.

\subsection{Unstable manifolds of \eqva\ and their heteroclinic
            connections}
\label{sec:unstMnflds}

In this section we explore the structure of unstable
manifolds of the {\eqva}.  As shown in \refTab{tab:Eksym},
the \EQV{1} \eqv\ has two unstable
planes within which the solutions are spiralling out (\ie, two
pairs of complex conjugate eigenvalues).  The \EQV{2} has one such plane,
while the \EQV{3} has two real positive eigenvalues, so the solutions are
moving radially away from the \eqv\ within the plane spanned
by the corresponding eigenvectors.  Since \EQV{1} has
a larger unstable subspace, it is expected to have much less influence on the
long time dynamics compared to \EQV{2} and \EQV{3}.

The left panel shows the unstable

coordinate axes $v_1$, $v_2$, and $v_3$ are constructed from vectors
$\Re \,\jEigvec{1}$, $\Im \,\jEigvec{1}$,
and $\Re \,\jEigvec{6}$

To construct an invariant manifold containing solutions
corresponding to the pair of unstable complex conjugate eigenvalues,
$\eigExp = \eigRe \pm i\eigIm$,
$\eigRe > 0$, we start with a set of
initial conditions near \eqv\ \EQV{k},
\beq
  a(0) = a_{{\EQV{k}}} + \epsilon\,\exp(\delta)\jEigvec{j}
\,,
\ee{linUnstMan}
where $\delta$ takes the set of values uniformly distributed in the
interval $[0,2\pi\eigRe/\eigIm]$, $\jEigvec{j}$ is a unit vector in the
unstable plane, and $\epsilon > 0$ is small.

The manifold starting within the first unstable plane of \EQV{1}, with
eigenvalues $0.1308\pm i\,0.3341$, is shown in
\reffig{f:KS22E1man1}. It appears to fall directly into the
chaotic attractor.  The behavior of the manifold starting within
the second unstable plane of \EQV{1}, eigenvalues $0.0824\pm i \, 0.3402$, is
remarkably different: as can be seen in \reffig{f:KS22E1man2},
all orbits within the manifold converge to the \eqv\ \EQV{2}.  The
manifold also contains a heteroclinic connection from \EQV{1} to \EQV{3},
and is bordered by the $\eigExp[1]$ unstable manifold of \EQV{3}.

The two-dimensional unstable manifold of \EQV{2} is shown in
\reffig{f:KS22E2man}.  All orbits within the manifold converge
to \EQV{2} shifted by $L/4$.  So this manifold can be viewed as a homoclinic
connection.  It also contains a pair of heteroclinic connections from
\EQV{2} to \EQV{3}.

The \eqv\ \EQV{3} has a pair of real unstable eigenvalues
equal to each other.  Therefore, within the plane spanned by the
corresponding eigenvectors, the orbits move radially away from
the \eqv.  In order to trace out the unstable manifold,
we start with a set of initial conditions within the unstable plane
\beq
 a(0) = a_{{\EQV{3}}} + \epsilon(v_1 \cos \phi + v_2 \sin \phi)\,,
  \quad\phi\in[0,2\pi]\,,
\label{unsManSeed}
\eeq
where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are orthonormal vectors within the
plane spanned by the two unstable eigenvectors, seeded as in
\refeq{linUnstMan}.
  The unstable manifold
of \EQV{3} is shown in \reffig{f:KS22E3man}.  The 3-fold symmetry of
the manifold is related to the symmetry of \EQV{3} with respect to
translation by $L/3$.  The manifold contains heteroclinic orbits
connecting \EQV{3} to three different points of the continuum of {\eqva}
\EQV{2}
translated by 0 and $\pm L/6$.  Note that there are two different
heteroclinic orbits ($B$ and $C$) connecting \EQV{3} to the same point in the
\EQV{2} continuum.  Note also that the segments of orbits $B$ and $C$
between \EQV{3} and \EQV{2} in \reffigs{f:KS22E1man2}{f:KS22E2man}
represent the same heteroclinic connections as orbits $B$ and $C$ in
\reffig{f:KS22E3man}.

An understanding of the ubiquity of heteroclinic connections in KSe, as
opposed to a general high-dimensional system, is provided in \refref{KNSks90}.
For our system size one has to notice that there are exactly two representatives
of the $\EQV{2}$ family that lie in the intersection of $\bbU^+$ and $\bbU^{(1)}$ related
to each other by an $L/4$ shift. Denote them by $\EQV{2}$ and $\Shift_{1/4}\EQV{2}$. The unstable eigenplane of
$\EQV{2}$ lies on $\bbU^+$ while that of $\Shift_{1/4}\EQV{2}$ lies on $\bbU^{(1)}$, \cf\ \reftab{tab:Eksym}. 
The $\EQV{3}$ family members that live in $\bbU^+$ have one of their unstable eigenvectors (the one related to the heteroclinic
connection to $\EQV{2}$ family)  on $\bbU^+$, while the other does not lie on an invariant subspace.
Similarly, for the $\EQV{1}$ family we observe that the equilibria in $\bbU^+$ have
an unstable plane on $\bbU^+$ (again related to the heteroclinic connection) and a second one with no symmetry. 
%Since $\bbU^{+}$ is invariant under the \KS\ flow the unstable manifolds (or their subspaces
Thus $\Shift_{1/4}\EQV{2}$ appears as a sink on $\bbU^+$, while all other equilibria appear as sources.
This explains the heteroclinic connections from $\EQV{1}\,,\EQV{2}$ and $\EQV{3}$ to $\Shift_{1/4}\EQV{2}$.
Observing that $\Shift_{1/4} \bbU^+= \bbU^{(1)}$ and taking into account \reftab{tab:Eksym} we understand that on $\bbU^{(1)}$
we have connections from $\Shift_{1/4}\EQV{2}$ (and the members of $\EQV{1}$ and $\EQV{3}$ families) to $\EQV{2}$ and the
formation of a heteroclinic loop. Due to the translational invariance of KSe there is a heteroclinic loop for any two points
of the $\EQV{2}$ family related by an $L/4$-shift.
