\section{Small $L=22$ system {\rpo s}}
\label{s:L22}
\file{L22eqv.tex}


\KS\ system with $L = 22$ periodic on the full space is small but
empirically large enough to exhibit persistent chaos.  $L=22$ is a
sensible choice because in units of mean wavelength the size of this
small system is about 2.5 wavelengths ($\tildeL/\sqrt{2}= 2.4758$),
so the dynamics is a competition between wavenumbers 2 and 3.
Because of the strong $k^4$ contraction in \KS\ we expect a small
number of eigenvalues to be significant for the dynamics, while the
rest are in the numerical noise. See figure~6 in
\refref{Christiansen:97}.

%% Davidchack and Crofts
% We investigate this system in 16 to 64 complex Fourier modes (32 to
%128-dimensional system of real ODEs) truncation, and recheck the results
%by redoing the calculation with the double number of Fourier modes. %
%observe how many digits change. The \eqv\ points are accurate to at least
%to $10^{-11}$. Since Lapack is also double precision accurate, the
%accuracy of the first few eigenvalues is similar, and certainly in excess
%of 6 significant digits. % All digits stated in tables are significant.
%The accuracy that can be reached is of order of
%$|a(\period{p},d_p) - a_0|
% \approx \epsilon \exp(\Lyap_p \period{p})$,
% where $\epsilon \approx 10^{-17}$ for double precision, $\Lyap_p$ is
%the largest Lyapunov exponent, and $\period{p}$ the period.  With a good
%starting guess, Newton's method typically reaches that accuracy after 2-3
%iterates.

\subsection{\Eqva}

In addition to the trivial equilibrium $u=0$ (denoted E0 from now
on), we find for $L = 22$ three \eqva\ with dominant wavenumber $k$
(denoted E$k$) for $k = 1, 2, 3$.  All equilibria, shown in
Fig.~\ref{f:KS22Equil}, are symmetric with respect to the reflection
symmetry. The \eqva\ E2 and E3 have additional symmetry with respect
to translation by $L/2$ and $L/3$, respectively.

The stability of the equilibria is characterized by the eigenvalues
$\lambda_j$ of the Jacobian matrix.  First ten eigenvalues for each
equilibrium are listed in Table~\ref{tab:Ek_eigs} in the order of
decreasing real parts. Recall that an equilibrium with $\mathrm{Re}
\lambda_j > 0$ is unstable in the direction of the corresponding
eigenvector $e_j$.

The eigenvalues of E0 are determined by the linear part of the \KS\
equation: $\lambda_k=(k/\tilde{L})^2-(k/\tilde{L})^4$.  For $L=22$,
there are three pairs of unstable eigenvalues corresponding to three
unstable modes $k=2,3$, and 1, respectively.  For each mode, the
corresponding eigenvectors lie in the plane spanned by
$\mathrm{Re}a_k$ and $\mathrm{Im}a_k$.


\subsection{Unstable invariant manifolds of \Eqva\ and heteroclinic
connections}

In this section we explore the structure of unstable invariant
manifolds of the equilibria.  The E1 equilibrium has two unstable
planes within which the solutions are spiralling out (i.e., two
pairs of complex conjugate eigenvalues).  The E2 has one such plane,
while the E3 has two real positive eigenvalues, so the solutions are
moving radially away from the equilibrium within the plane spanned
by the corresponding eigenvectors.  Since E1 has larger unstable
subspace, it is expected that it will have much less influence on
the system evolution compared to E2 and E3.

To construct an unstable manifold containing solutions corresponding
to the pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues, $\lambda = \sigma\pm
i\omega$, $\sigma > 0$, we start with a set of initial conditions
\[ a(0) = a_{\mathrm{E}k} + \epsilon \mathrm{e}^{\delta} v \]
where $\delta$ takes the set of values uniformly distributed in the
interval $[0,2\pi\sigma/\omega]$, $v$ is a unit vector in the
unstable invariant plane, and $\epsilon > 0$ is small.

\RLD{got here}

The unstable manifold plane
is traced out in \reffig{f:neighborhood2w}(a).
Computed the 2 expanding eigenvectors of the
\eqv\ {\nameit}2, as well as the 3rd, least contracting direction; then
translated and rotated Fourier modes into this coordinate frame,
plotted the unstbale manifold.
% trajectory there, both in the lab and the mean velocity frame.


 It is the unstable manifold of the \nameit 2
{\eqv}, drawn by tracing out a set of points along one of the complex
eigenvectors, that start close to it. Surprisingly, everybody goes connects
to the \nameit 2 shifts by 1/2 wavelength (d = L/4 = 5.5) but as we are in
infty dimensions they do it not as the usual homoclinic connection, but in
many (all?) possible intermediate ways. This might be a clue for how to
partition symbolic dynamics. Note also that in your L22-long.eps one seems
to come quite close to \nameit 2 {\eqv}, so it might be a very dominant
influence on the strange attractor dynamics


The appears to be a heteroclinic connection from \nameit 2
{\eqv}
unstable spiral out straight into \nameit 3 {\eqv}
$\period{} = 76.6$ \rpo\ seems like a closeby
relative of this.
That also means that the relative shift between the two {\eqva} is
fixed, as far as this conection is concerned.

What is great about
this is that the \nameit 2 unstable manifold has a heteroclinic connection to itself
$L/2$ shifted, but
even better, to \nameit 2, and \nameit 3 unstable manifold has a heteroclinic
connection to \nameit 2.
It's really pretty. That makes for a rigid backbone -
we hope this will help us develop a symbolic dynamics for rpo's.

It is very unlikely
that a single 1-$d$ Poincar\'e section,
can do the job,
previous work\rf{Lan:Thesis,LanCvi06}
always needed several sections.

The idea is that the local unstable plane gives 2 coordinates, the
least contracting direction (or one of a complex pair) gives the 3rd.

We need to construct the backbone of heteroclinic connections
first. They are not like 3-$d$ R\"ossler and Lorenz examples:
here one spirals out,
then spirals in - hopefully there will be intelligent Poincare sections
transverse to initial \nameit 2 (or \nameit 3) unstable manifold, mapping onto
Poincare sections of trajectories leaving again
the next \nameit 3 or \nameit 2 unstable manifold.


Check next what these 2 unstable eigenvectors for \nameit 3 eqv. are - when they
are equal in magnitude you expect a `star', all directions in their plane
going straight out. Do they all fall int \nameit 2 eqv?

For all spatial plots color axis $u \in [-3, 3]$ is the same,
same time units and spatial width $L$.
For the steady states the magnitude of the \nameit 2 is quite
a bit smaller than that of the \nameit 3.

On the
    $[a_?,a_?]$ plane
    the $\sigma x = -x$ symmetry of \KSe\ is explicit.


steady\_states1.jpg shows the numerical evolution and, since the
traveling wave is very unstable, it disappears after awhile.
The numerically exact solution is plotted in steady\_states2.jpg

rpos1.jpg is attached as a sample.

As it looks, will not help us with partitioning, it seems, unless there is
a trajectory that hits the contracting direction - maybe
( -0.11941393,0)
head on.

Might want to look at this blowup in
the \nameit 2 slowest contraction
$   ( -0.08402656 \pm i 0.16019413)$
complex eigenvectors plane, check whether the
spiralling rotation agrees with the real/imaginary parts of eigenvalues.

Question is still - why does all of the unstable manifold of
\nameit 2 eqv go back
into
\nameit 2 eqv?

\subsection{\Reqva}

Numerical solution of the \reqv\  condition,
transported by travelling wave velocity $c$,
fixed by the solution for the travelling wave equation:
\[
f_k(u) - i{2\pi\over L} c k u_k = 0
\]

\underline{1-\reqv\  (travelling wave).}
% Ruslan L Davidchack,  10 Jul 2006
There is a pair of \reqva\
${\nameit}1L$,
${\nameit}1R$
(traveling waves), dual under the
$u(x) \to -u(-x)$ symmetry. They are
determined numerically by
adiabatic continuation from a smaller system size
$L~\approx 12$,
where they are stable, to $L=22$
where their velocity is atypically large, $c=7.???$,

Their exponents are:
\\
$\Lyap_i \pm \theta_i =
(
\\
  0.1156222 \pm 0.817289,   \\
  0.033663 \pm 0.418909,    \\
 0.0                    ,   \\
 -0.245729                    , \\
 -0.321321 \pm 0.98126,
\cdots
)$

The pair of \reqva\
${\nameit}2L$,
${\nameit}2R$
exists for larger system sizes, but does not continue
adiabatically\rf{KNSks90} down to $L=22$.

\PC{
 add the left/right $\REQV{\pm}{1}$ pair to \reffig{f:eqvSpatial}
    }
The $u=0$  \eqv\ $\EQV{0}$ is a point at the origin
in \reffig{f:eqvSpatial}.
At
each integer value of $\tildeL$ the origin spews out a Hopf cycle. That
might help us prove that we have all equilibria for $L=22$.

Each of these \eqva\ has a different value of the $c$ integration
constant.

Plot also the two \eqva\ of \eqva\ points, their
real eigenvectors and their complex eigenplanes. All equilibria presumably
wind around these, and as box size $L$ changes, they form continuous
families with smoothly changing $c$. One can check that by
changing $L$ a bit and using the previous equilibrium to find the next
one.

What does the complex eigenplane continuation does for these
equilibria - does it produce nice heteroclinic connections, or is it
wierder? We know there is an analytic formula for a heteroclinic
connection (see \refref{Lan:Thesis}). % Lan's thesis).

The real motivation for all this is that if we understand \eqva\ as
$L \to \infty$ we might have an entry into $L = \infty$ periodic orbit
theory of KS.
