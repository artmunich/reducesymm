% \label{sec:L22}
% Predrag created file              jul  9 2006

Having set up the theory of \KSe, we can explore Hopf's vision
numerically, on a specific KS system.
An instructive example is offered by the dynamics for $L=22$
that we specialize to for the rest of this paper.
  For this small periodic cell the empirically observed
`sustained turbulence' arises from a competition between unstable
wavelength 2- and 3- coherent structures.  As is true of
any realistic `chaotic' flow, we have no rigorous way of
establishing that this turbulence is indeed sustained for all time, or
is merely a very long transient to an attracting periodic state.  For
large system size, as the one shown in \reffig{f:ks_largeL}, it is
hard to imagine scenario under which attractive periodic states
(which, as shown in \refref{FSTks86}, exist) would have significantly
large basins of attraction.

\KS\ system with $L = 22$ periodic on the full space is small but
empirically large enough to exhibit persistent chaos.  $L=22$ is a
sensible choice because in units of mean wavelength the size of this
small system is about 2.5 wavelengths ($\tildeL/\sqrt{2}= 2.4758$),
so the dynamics is a competition between wave numbers 2 and 3.
Because of the strong $k^4$ contraction we expect a small
number of modes to be significant for the dynamics, while the
rest are in the numerical noise. See Figure~6 in
\refref{Christiansen:97}.

The leading Lyapunov exponents of the chaotic attractor are
0.048, 0, 0, -0.003, -0.189, -0.256, -0.290, ... , which shows that
the attractor lives essentially on a 4-dimensional manifold with strong
contraction in other dimensions.  The two zero exponents correspond to
time and space translational symmetries of the KS solutions, so the
dynamics on the attractor appears to be reducible to a 2-dimensional map.

We start by determining
all \eqva\ and many \rpo s for
KS in a periodic cell of size $L=22$.

\section{\Eqva\ and \reqva}

The 2-, 3-\eqva\  essentially lie in
the 2nd, respectively 3rd Fourier component complex plane, with
small deformations from higher harmonics.
    \PC{
    don't you want to refer to the symmetry section, say
    that they have only $k=2j$, $k=3j$ Fourier components,
    respectively?
    }
We refer to wavelength 1-, 2- and 3- unstable \eqva\ as
\EQV{1}, \EQV{2} and \EQV{3},
respectively.
In \reffig{f:ks_largeL}
color indicates the value of $u(x,t)$ in
the $(x,t)$ space-time plane.

In addition to the trivial \eqv\ $u=0$ (denoted \EQV{0} from now
on), we find for $L = 22$ three \eqva\ with dominant wavenumber $k$
(denoted \EQV{k}) for $k = 1, 2, 3$.  All {\eqva}, shown in
Fig.~\ref{f:KS22Equil}, are symmetric with respect to the reflection
symmetry \refeq{KSparity}.
In addition, \EQV{2} and \EQV{3} are symmetric with respect
to translation \refeq{KSshift},
by $L/2$ and $L/3$, respectively.

The stability of the {\eqva} is characterized by the eigenvalues
$\eigExp[j]$ of the \stabmat.  The leading 10 eigenvalues for each
\eqv\ are listed in \reftab{tab:Eksym}. We compute (available upon request)
the corresponding eigenvectors as well. As an \eqv\ with $\mathrm{Re}
\lambda_j > 0$ is unstable in the direction of the corresponding
eigenvector $\jEigvec{j}$, the eigenvectors provide flow-intrinsic
(PDE discretization independent) coordinates which we use for visualization
of unstable manifolds and homo- / hetero-clinic connections between
\eqva.

The eigenvalues of \EQV{0} are determined by the linear part of the KS
equation \refeq{expanMvar}: $\lambda_k=(k/\tilde{L})^2-(k/\tilde{L})^4$.
For $L=22$, there are three pairs of unstable eigenvalues, corresponding,
in decreasing order, to three unstable modes $k=2,3$, and 1.  For each
mode, the corresponding eigenvectors lie in the plane spanned by
$\Re \, a_k$ and $\Im \, a_k$. \refTab{tab:Eksym}
lists the symmetries of the stability eigenvectors of
\eqva\ \EQV{1} to \EQV{3}.

\subsection{Unstable manifolds of \eqva\ and their heteroclinic
            connections}
\label{sec:unstMnflds}

In this section we explore the structure of unstable
manifolds of the {\eqva}.  The \EQV{1} \eqv\ has two unstable
planes within which the solutions are spiralling out (\ie, two
pairs of complex conjugate eigenvalues).  The \EQV{2} has one such plane,
while the \EQV{3} has two real positive eigenvalues, so the solutions are
moving radially away from the \eqv\ within the plane spanned
by the corresponding eigenvectors.  Since \EQV{1} has
a larger unstable
subspace, it is expected to have much less influence on the
long time dynamics compared to \EQV{2} and \EQV{3}.

To construct an invariant manifold containing solutions
corresponding to the pair of unstable complex conjugate eigenvalues,
$\eigExp = \eigRe \pm i\eigIm$,
$\eigRe > 0$, we start with a set of
initial conditions near \eqv\ \EQV{k},
\beq
  a(0) = a_{{\EQV{k}}} + \epsilon\,\exp(\delta)\jEigvec{j}
\,,
\ee{linUnstMan}
where $\delta$ takes the set of values uniformly distributed in the
interval $[0,2\pi\eigRe/\eigIm]$, $\jEigvec{j}$ is a unit vector in the
unstable plane, and $\epsilon > 0$ is small.

The manifold starting within the first unstable plane of \EQV{1}, with
eigenvalues $0.1308\pm i\, 0.3341$, is shown in
\reffig{f:KS22E1man1}. It appears to fall directly into the
chaotic attractor.  The behavior of the manifold starting within
the second unstable plane of \EQV{1}, eigenvalues $0.0824\pm i \, 0.3402$, is
remarkably different: as can be seen in \reffig{f:KS22E1man2},
all orbits within the manifold converge to the \eqv\ \EQV{2}.  The
manifold also contains a heteroclinic connection from \EQV{1} to \EQV{3},
and is bordered by the $\eigExp[1]$ unstable manifold of \EQV{3}.

The two-dimensional unstable manifold of \EQV{2} is shown in
\reffig{f:KS22E2man}.  All orbits within the manifold converge
to \EQV{2} shifted by $L/4$.  So this manifold can be viewed as a homoclinic
connection.  It also contains a pair of heteroclinic connections from
\EQV{2} to \EQV{3}.

The \eqv\ \EQV{3} has a pair of real unstable eigenvalues
equal to each other.  Therefore, within the plane spanned by the
corresponding eigenvectors, the orbits move radially away from
the \eqv.  In order to trace out the unstable manifold,
we start with a set of initial conditions within the unstable plane
\beq
 a(0) = a_{{\EQV{3}}} + \epsilon(v_1 \cos \phi + v_2 \sin \phi)\,,
  \quad\phi\in[0,2\pi]\,,
\label{unsManSeed}
\eeq
where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are orthonormal vectors within the
plane spanned by the two unstable eigenvectors, seeded as in
\refeq{linUnstMan}.
  The unstable manifold
of \EQV{3} is shown in \reffig{f:KS22E3man}.  The 3-fold symmetry of
the manifold is related to the symmetry of \EQV{3} with respect to
translation by $L/3$.  The manifold contains heteroclinic orbits
connecting \EQV{3} to three different points of the continuum of {\eqva}
\EQV{2}
translated by 0 and $\pm L/6$.  Note that there are two different
heteroclinic orbits ($B$ and $C$) connecting \EQV{3} to the same point in the
\EQV{2} continuum.  Note also that the segments of orbits $B$ and $C$
between \EQV{3} and \EQV{2} in \reffigs{f:KS22E1man2}{f:KS22E2man}
represent the same heteroclinic connections as orbits $B$ and $C$ in
\reffig{f:KS22E3man}.

\caption{
The left panel shows the two-dimensional
unstable manifold of \eqv\ \EQV{3}. The coordinate axes
$v_1$, $v_2$, and $v_3$ are constructed from vectors
$\jEigvec{1}$, $\jEigvec{2}$, and $\jEigvec{4}$ by Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.
The black line shows a family of \EQV{2}~\eqva\ related by translational
symmetry. The right panel shows spatial representation of
three orbits. Orbits $B$ and $C$ are two different heteroclinic orbits
connecting \EQV{3} to the same point on the \EQV{2} line.

\PC{Check next what these 2 unstable eigenvectors for \EQV{3}~\eqv\ are
    - when they are equal in magnitude you expect a `star',
    all directions in their plane going straight out.
    Do they all fall into \EQV{2}~\eqv?
