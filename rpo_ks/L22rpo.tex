\section{\Rpo s}

The \rpo s satisfy the condition $u(x+\Delta,T) = u(x,0)$, where $T$
is the period and $\Delta$ the phase shift of \rpo .  We have
limited our search to orbits with $T < 200$ and found over 160 prime
orbits with $\Delta \ge 0$.  Each orbit with phase shift $\Delta$
has a reflection symmetric partner with phase shift $-\Delta$
related by the transformation $u(x) \to -u(-x)$.

The search has not been exhaustive, and there are likely to be more
orbits with $T < 200$, especially with longer periods.  However, the
orbits we've found provide a representative sample of typical \rpo s
and approximate well the chaotic attractor (since they were located
using seeds obtained from close returns within the chaotic
dynamics).

\reffig{f:ks22rposT} shows the \rpo s in the plane $(T,\Delta)$.

The largest Lyapunov exponent of \rpo s is shown in
\reffig{f:ks22rposL}.

Next we describe several types of \rpo s.

\subsection{Short \rpo s}  The small period \rpo s outline the
coarse structure of the chaotic attractor, while the longer period
\rpo s typically just resolve the finer details of the dynamics
without significant modification of this structure.

The first five orbits with the shortest period we've detected are
shown in \reffig{f:ks22rposShort}.

\subsection{\Rpo s close to the unstable manifold of \EQV{2} }
We have found a number of \rpo s which stay very close to the
unstable manifold of \EQV{2}.  This confirms that the "cage" of
unstable manifolds of equilibria plays an important role in
organizing the chaotic dynamics of \KS\ equation.

\subsection{Periodic Orbits}
A \rpo will be exactly periodic, i.e. $\Delta = 0$, if it has one of
two symmetries: 1) $u(x,0) = -u(-x,0)$ or 2) $u(x,T/2) = -u(-x,0)$.
In the first case the whole orbit lives within the antisymmetric
subspace. The dynamics of \KS equation in the antisymmetric subspace
has been investigated in [\RLD{include references}]. The \KS
equation with $L = 22$ does not have any periodic orbits of this
type. % The second symmetry implies that the \rpo is

We have found eight exactly periodic orbits with $T < 200$.  The
shortest such orbit is shown in \reffig{f:ks22rposShort}(b).  Some
of the other periodic orbits are shown in \reffig{f:ks22pos}.


\subsection{Least unstable \rpo s ???}

The dynamics in this small system is competition between wavenumbers
2 and 3. The 2-\eqv\  and the 3-\eqv\  essentially lie in
the 2nd and 3rd Fourier component complex plane, with very
small deformations from higher harmonics.
Hence plot all \rpo s in these 2 representations:

$[ \Re a_2, \Im a_2, \Re a_3 ]$
(here 2-\eqv\  is a circle, 3-\eqv\ a vertical line)
 and
$[ \Re a_3, \Im a_3, \Re a_2 ]$
(here 3-\eqv\ is a circle, 2-\eqv\ a vertical line)

\ES{
The names of the \rpo\ figure files follow the convention
 {\tt rpoL-T-d.eps}s, with suffixes {\tt cm}
and {\tt u} indicating
 mean velocity frame  and $u$ representation respectively.
   }
%
Out of 30 \rpo s we
find,  only three are truly periodic.  The orbit
with $\period{p} = 95.25$ has a very small
$d = -6.5\,\times 10^{-7}$, but it is not periodic
(we
checked this by decreasing the integration step size and increasing the
number of modes).

Sets of \rpo s are difficult to visualize simultaneously.
For ordinary \po s one
plots the unstable plane of the \eqv, shows where the periodic
orbits sit. Other options:

Somewhat better visualization is in the
{\em mean velocity frame}, {\ie}
a reference frame that rotates with with velocity
$v_p=d_p/\period{p}$
In the mean velocity frame a \rpo\ becomes
a \po, see  for example \refeq{f:rpo55}.
Mean velocity frame visualization helps quite a bit.
Put a black (green, respectively) dot
twice thickness of the line every time unit; it will enable you to see
where the motion is slow and where it is fast.
% (a trick we used to understand plane Couette trajectories).
Mark the initial point on both
mean velocity \rpo\ and on \eqv\  in mean velocity
 frame with a fat triangle
indicating the direction, so we can see how they both move. Probably at the
opposite ends of the two curves - mean velocity frame is the mean motion.

Each {\rpo} has its own mean velocity frame - and within it, {\eqv}
move on circles (or worse - because in higher Fourier modes they do more
complicated things), and it is important to know where the {\eqv} is at
a given instant.

As the shift $d$ is defined mod~$L$, better to
state for each {\rpo} its mean velocity $c_p = d_p/\period{p}$,
where $d_p$ is measured on the line (not on the circle). $c_p$ is
preferable to angle $2\pi d_p/L$ as it does not vary in $L \to$~large
limit (just like $\sqrt{2}$ wavelength estimate is independent of
system size.

Another convenient way to plot \eqva\ and \reqva\ on a periodic
domain $L$ is to plot
$\partial u(x)$ vs. $u(x)$ as a curve parametrized by
$x\in [0,L]$. In this representation both \eqva\ and \reqva\ curves are
stationary, but the points on \reqva\ move as functions of time.

\Po s and \rpo s can be plotted this way as well
$\partial u(x,t)$ vs. $u(x,t)$. Now they are are represented by time-dependent
``tube".

\refFig{f:ks22RE}(b)
depicts \REQV{+}{2}.
It belongs to the branch starting at point $M$
\PC{does it start at M?}
in bifurcation diagram \reffig{fig:ksBifDiag}.
It has one real unstable eigenvalue = 0.337,
so it is more unstable than \REQV{+}{1},
but only in 1\dmn\ (\REQV{+}{1} is unstable in 4\dmn).
