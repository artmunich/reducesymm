Sets of \rpo s are difficult to visualize simultaneously.
Somewhat better visualization is in the
{\em mean velocity frame}, {\ie},
a reference frame that rotates with with velocity
$v_p=\shift_p/\period{p}$.
In the mean velocity frame a \rpo\ becomes
a \po, see  for example \reffig{f:MeanVelocityFrame}.
On the other hand each {\rpo} has its own mean velocity frame and thus
the simultaneous visualization of \rpo s becomes problematic.

As the shift $d$ is defined mod~$L$, better to
state for each {\rpo} its mean velocity $c_p = \shift_p/\period{p}$,
where $\shift_p$ is measured on the line (not on the circle). $c_p$ is
preferable to angle $2\pi \shift_p/L$ as it does not vary in $L \to$~large
limit (just like $\sqrt{2}$ wavelength estimate is independent of
system size).
