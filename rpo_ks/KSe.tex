The \KS\ [henceforth KS] system\rf{ku,siv},
which arises in the description of
stability of flame fronts, reaction-diffusion systems and many other
physical settings\rf{KNSks90}, is one of the simplest nonlinear PDEs that
exhibit spatiotemporally chaotic behavior. In the formulation
adopted here, the time evolution of the `flame front velocity'
$u=u(x,t)$ on a periodic domain $u(x,t) = u(x+L,t)$ is given by
\beq
  u_t = F(u) = -{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}(u^2)_x-u_{xx}-u_{xxxx}=0
% abandoned the CCP convention: u_t=(u^2)_x-u_{xx}- u_{xxxx}
    \,,\qquad   x \in [-L/2,L/2]
    \,.
\ee{ks}
Here $t \geq 0$ is the time, and $x$ is the spatial coordinate.
The subscripts $x$ and $t$ denote partial derivatives with respect to
$x$ and $t$.
% In the literature \refeq{ks} is sometimes written as
% \[ %beq
%     u_t=(u^2)_x-u_{xx}- \nu \, u_{xxxx}
%     \,,\qquad   x \in [0,L]
%     \,,
% \] %\ee{ksVisc}
% or in any number of other variants, all equivalent.
In what follows
we shall state results of all calculations either in units of the
`dimensionless system size' $\tildeL$, or the system size $L = 2 \pi
\tildeL$. %, with the `hyper-viscosity' $\nu$ fixed to $1$. Other
% authors vary  $\nu$, with $L$ fixed to either $1$ or $2\pi$.
All numerical results presented in this paper
are for the system size $\tildeL=22/2\pi = 3.5014\ldots$.
Spatial periodicity $u(x,t)=u(x+L,t)$
makes it convenient to work in the Fourier space,
\beq
  u(x,t)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} a_k (t) e^{ i k x /\tildeL }
\,,
% \label{fseries}
\ee{eq:ksexp}
%where $\tildeL=L/2\pi$. Thus,
with the $1$-dimensional PDE \refeq{ks}
replaced by an infinite set of
ODEs for the complex Fourier coefficients $a_k(t)$:
\beq
\dot{a}_k= \pVeloc_k(a)
     = ( q_k^2 - q_k^4 )\, a_k
    - i \frac{q_k}{2} \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} a_m a_{k-m}
\,,
\ee{expan}
where $q_k = k/\tildeL$.
Since $u(x,t)$ is real, $a_k=a_{-k}^\ast$, and we can replace the
sum by a $k > 0$ sum.

% \PC{find better place for this text?}
Due to the hyperviscous damping $u_{xxxx}$, long time solutions of KS
equation are smooth, $a_k$ drop off fast
% \PC{how fast?}
with $k$,
and truncations of \refeq{expan} to $16 \leq d \leq 128$  terms
yield accurate solutions for system sizes considered here.
Robustness of the long-time dynamics of KS as a function of the
number of Fourier modes kept in truncations of \refeq{expan} is, however,
a subtle issue.
Adding an extra mode to a truncation of the system
introduces a small perturbation in the space of dynamical
systems. However, due to the lack
of structural stability both as a function of truncation $d$, and the
system size \tildeL, a small variation in a system parameter
can (and often will) throw the dynamics
into a different asymptotic state.
For example, asymptotic attractor
which appears to be chaotic in a $d$-dimensional
\statesp\ truncation can
collapse into an attractive period-$n$ cycle for
$(d\!+\!1)$-dimensions.

\subsection{Symmetries of \KSe}
\label{sec:KSeSymm}

The KS equation is Galilean invariant: if $u(x,t)$ is a solution,
then $u(x -ct,t) -c $, with $c$ an arbitrary constant
speed, is also a solution. Without loss of generality, in our
calculations we shall set the mean velocity of the front to zero,
\beq \int dx \, u = 0 \,. \ee{GalInv}
As $\dot{a_0}=0$ in
\refeq{expan}, $a_0$ is a conserved quantity%, in our calculations
fixed to $a_0=0$ by the
% Galilean invariance
condition \refeq{GalInv}. $G$, the group of actions $ g \in G $ on a
\statesp\ (reflections, translations, \etc) is a symmetry of the KS
flow \refeq{ks} if $g\,u_t = F(g\,u)$.
The KS equation % \refeq{ks},
%\beq
%\dot{u} =
%F(u) = -u u_x-u_{xx}- u_{xxxx}
%% \,,
%\ee{KSO2}
is time
translationally invariant, and space translationally invariant
on a periodic domain under
the 1-parameter group of
\PCedit{
$O(2): \{\Shift_{\shift/L},\Refl \}$.
       }
If $u(x,t)$ is a solution, then
$\Shift_{\shift/L}\, u(x,t) = u(x+\shift,t)$
is an equivalent solution for any shift
$-L/2 < \shift \leq L/2$,
as is the
reflection (`parity' or `inversion')
\beq
    \Refl \, u(x) = -u(-x)
\,.
\ee{KSparity}
The translation operator action on the Fourier coefficients
%% \beq
%%   (\Shift_{\shift/L}\, a)_k= e^{i q_k\, \shift} \, a_k
%%     \qquad \mbox{(no summation on $k$)}
%%     \,.
%%     \label{eq:RPOcondFouri}
%% \eeq
(represented here by a complex valued vector
$a = \{a_k\in\mathbb{C}\,|\,k = 1, 2, \ldots\}$) is given by
\beq
  \Shift_{\shift/L}\, a = \mathbf{g}(\shift) \, a \,,
  \label{eq:shiftFour}
\eeq
where $\mathbf{g}(\shift) = \diag( e^{i q_k\, \shift} )$ is a
complex valued diagonal matrix, which
amounts to the $k$-th mode complex plane rotation by an angle
$-k\, \shift /\tildeL$. The reflections acts on the Fourier
coefficients by complex conjugation,
\beq
  \Refl \, a = -a^\ast
%  \Refl \, a_k = -a_k^\ast
% a_{2m} \to a_{2m}
\,.
\ee{FModInvSymm}
Reflection generates the dihedral subgroup $D_1 = \{1, \Refl\}$
of $O(2)$.  Let $\bbU$ be the space of
real-valued velocity fields periodic and square integrable
on the interval $\Omega = [-L/2,L/2]$,
\begin{align}
 \bbU  &= \{u \in L^2(\Omega) \; | \; u(x) = u(x+L)\}  \,.
\end{align}
A continuous symmetry maps each state $u \in \bbU$
to a manifold of functions with identical dynamic behavior.
Relation $\Refl^2 = 1$ induces linear decomposition
$u(x) = u^+(x)+ u^-(x)$,
\PCedit{
$u^\pm(x)= P^\pm u(x) \in  \bbU^\pm$,
into irreducible subspaces
$
\bbU = \bbU^+  % \oplus  \bbUsymm
       \oplus \bbU^-
$, where
        }
\beq
    P^+=(\matId+\Refl)/2
    \,,\qquad
    P^-=(\matId-\Refl)/2
\ee{P1P2proj} are the antisymmetric/symmetric projection operators.
Applying $P^+,\,P^-$ on the KS equation \refeq{ks} we have\rf{KNSks90}
\bea
 u_t^+ &=& - (u^+u^+_x + u^-u^-_x )
                - u^+_{xx} - u^+_{xxxx}
    \continue
 u_t^- &=& - (u^+u^-_x + u^-u^+_x )
                - u^-_{xx} - u^-_{xxxx}
\,.
\label{KSD1}
\eea
If $u^- = 0$, KS flow is confined to
the antisymmetric $\bbU^+$ subspace,
\beq
 u_t^+ = - u^+u^+_x
                - u^+_{xx} - u^+_{xxxx}
%        \,,\qquad   x \in
\,,
\label{KSU+}
\eeq
but otherwise the nonlinear terms in \refeq{KSD1}
mix the two subspaces.

Together with any rational shift $ \Shift_{1/m}u(x)=u(x+L/m)$
reflection generates a discrete dihedral subgroup $D_m$ of $O(2)$, also
a symmetry of KS system. The only non-zero Fourier components of a
solution invariant under $D_m$ are $a_{jm} \neq 0$, $j =1,2,\cdots$ .
$D_m$ reduces the dimensionality of \statesp\ and aids computation of
\eqva\ and \po s within it. For example, the 1/2-cell translations \beq
    \Shift_{1/2}\, u(x)=u(x+L/2)
\,,
\ee{KSshift}
and reflections generate $O(2)$
subgroup $D_2 = \{1, \Refl,\Shift,\Shift\Refl\}$,
which
reduces the \statesp\ into four irreducible subspaces
(for brevity, here $\Shift = \Shift_{1/2}$):
\PC{dangerous edit, changed $S \to A$ for reflections,
    please cross-check}
\PCedit{
\begin{align}
 & \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad
              ~~~ \Shift ~~ \Refl  ~\;  \Shift\Refl
    \nnu\\
P^{(1)} &= \frac{1}{4} (1 + \Shift + \Refl + \Shift\Refl)
           ~~~~  S  ~~  A   ~~   A
    \nnu\\
P^{(2)} &= \frac{1}{4} (1 + \Shift - \Refl - \Shift\Refl)
            ~~~~  S  ~~  S   ~~   S
    \nnu\\
P^{(3)} &= \frac{1}{4} (1 - \Shift + \Refl - \Shift\Refl)
           ~~~~  A  ~~  A   ~~   S
     \label{ek_defn}\\
P^{(4)} &= \frac{1}{4} (1 - \Shift - \Refl + \Shift\Refl)
          ~~~~  A  ~~  S   ~~   A
\,.
    \nnu
\end{align}
        }
$P^{(j)}$ is the projection operator onto
$u^{(j)}$ irreducible subspace, and the last 3 columns
refer to the symmetry of
$u^{(j)}$ functions under reflection and
1/2-cell shift.
By the same argument that identified \refeq{KSU+} as
the invariant subspace of KS, here the KS flow
stays within the
 $\bbU^S =  \bbU^{(1)}+ \bbU^{(2)}$
irreducible $D_1$ subspace of
\PCedit{
$u$
       }
profiles symmetric under 1/2-cell shifts.

\PCedit{
While in general the bilinear term $(u^2)_x$  mixes the
irreducible subspaces of $D_n$, for $D_2$ there are
four subspaces invariant under the flow\rf{KNSks90}:
\begin{romannum} % SIAM itemize}
 \item[$\{0\}$:~~~~~~] the $u(x)=0$ {\eqv}
 \item[$\bbU^+ = \bbU^{(1)}+ \bbU^{(3)} $:]
    the reflection $D_1$ irreducible space of antisymmetric $u(x)$
 \item[$\bbU^S =  \bbU^{(1)}+ \bbU^{(2)}$:]
    the shift $D_1$ irreducible space of $L/2$ shift symmetric  $u(x)$
 \item[$\bbU^{(1)}$:~~~~~]
    the $D_2$ irreducible  space of $u(x)$ invariant under $x\mapsto L/2-x,\ u\mapsto -u$
\end{romannum} %itemize}
as long as all other components of $u(x)$ are
set to zero (see for example \refeq{KSU+}).
        } % end \PCedit
With the continuous
translational symmetry eliminated within each subspace, there are no
\reqva\ and \rpo s, and one
can focus on the \eqva\ and \po s only, as was done
for $\bbU^+$ in \refrefs{Christiansen:97,Lan:Thesis,LanCvi07}.
In the Fourier
representation, the
\PCedit{
$u \in \bbU^+$
    }
antisymmetry amounts to having purely imaginary
coefficients, since $a_{-k}= a^\ast_k = -a_k$.
The 1/2 cell-size shift $\Shift_{1/2}$
generated 2-element discrete subgroup
$\{1,\Shift_{1/2}\}$ is
of particular interest
because in the
\PCedit{
$\bbU^+$
       }
subspace the translational invariance of the full system reduces to
invariance under discrete translation \refeq{KSshift} by half a
spatial period $L/2$.

Each of the above dynamically invariant subspaces is unstable
under small perturbations, and generic solutions of \KSe\ belong to
the full space.
Nevertheless, since  all \eqva\ of the KS flow studied in this paper
lie in the $\bbU^+$ subspace (see
\refsect{sec:L22}), $\bbU^+$  plays important role for the global
geometry of the flow.
However, linear stability of these \eqva\ has
eigenvectors both in and outside of $\bbU^+$, and needs to be
computed in the full \statesp.

\Eqva\  (or the steady solutions)
are the fixed profile time-invariant solutions,
\beq
 u(x,t) = u_\stagn(x) %\,,\quad t \in \mathbb{R}
\,.
\ee{eqva}
Due to the translational symmetry,
the KS system also allows for
\reqva\ (traveling waves, rotating waves),
characterized by a fixed profile $u_\stagn(x)$
moving with constant speed $c$, {\ie}
\beq
 u(x,t) =  u_\stagn(x-ct) %\,,\quad t \in \mathbb{R}
\,.
\ee{reqva}
Here suffix ${}_\stagn$ labels a particular invariant solution.
Because of the reflection symmetry \refeq{KSparity},
the \reqva\ come in counter-traveling pairs
$u_\stagn(x-ct)$, $-u_\stagn(-x+ct)$.

The \reqv\ condition for the {\KS} PDE \refeq{ks}
is the ODE
\beq
{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}(u^2)_x+u_{xx}+ u_{xxxx}=c \, u_x
% \,.
\ee{KSeqvCond}
which can be analyzed as a dynamical system in its own right.

This equation can be interpreted as a 3-dimen\-si\-on\-al dynamical system
with spatial coordinate $x$ playing the role of `time' and integration constant \expctE\ can be interpreted as `energy',
see \refsect{sec:energy}.

For $\expctE>0$ there is rich
$\expctE$-dependent dynamics, with
fractal sets of bounded solutions investigated in
depth by Michelson\rf{Mks86}.

% \label{sec:KSlit}
% Vaggelis               jan 20 2007
%
For $\tildeL<1$ the only \eqv\ of the system is the
globally attracting constant
solution $u(x,t)=0$, denoted $\EQV{0}$ from now on. With increasing system size $L$ the system
undergoes a series of bifurcations.
The resulting \eqva\ and
\reqva\ (but not \po s and \rpo s)
are described in the classical papers of
Kevrekidis, Nicolaenko and Scovel\rf{KNSks90},
and Greene and Kim\rf{ksgreene88}.
The relevant bifurcations
up to the system size
investigated here are summarized
in \reffig{fig:ksBifDiag}:
at $\tildeL=22/2\pi =
3.5014\cdots$, the {\eqva} are the constant solution
\EQV{0}, the GLMRT\rf{laquey74,ksgreene88} \eqv\ \EQV{1}, the $2$-
and $3$-cell states \EQV{2} and \EQV{3},
and the pairs of \reqva\ \REQV{\pm}{1}, \REQV{\pm}{2}.

%\RLD{This paragraph should probably be moved down after real-space
%equation for equilibria and traveling waves are discussed.}
In the Fourier representation the \reqva\ time
dependence is
\beq
 a_k(t) e^{-itc q_k} = a_k(0)
\,.
\ee{reqvaF}
Differentiating with respect to time, we obtain
the Fourier space version of the \reqv\ condition
\refeq{KSeqvCond},
\beq
 \pVeloc_k(a) - i q_k c a_k = 0
\,,
\ee{reqvCondF}
which we solve for (time independent) $a_k$ and $c$.
Periods of spatially periodic {\eqva} are multiples of $L$.
Every time the system size crosses  $\tildeL=n$,
$n$-cell states
are generated through pitchfork bifurcations off $u =0$
equilibrium.
Due to the translational invariance of {\KSe},
they form invariant circles
in the full \statesp.
In the $\bbU^+$ subspace considered here,
they correspond to $2n$ points, each shifted by $L/2n$.
For a sufficiently small $L$
the number of {\eqva} is small and
concentrated on the low wave-number end of the Fourier spectrum.

In a periodic box of size $L$
both \eqva\ and \reqva\ are  periodic solutions
embedded in 3-$d$ space,
conveniently represented as loops in
$(u,u_x,u_{xx})$ space%
% \ES{dropped whose topology is controlled by the
%`\eqva\ of \eqva' stable-unstable manifold structure of
%\refeq{eqvEqvEigV} }
, see \reffig{f:KS22Equil}\,(\textit{d}).
In this representation the continuous translation symmetry
is automatic -- a rotation in the $[0,L]$ periodic domain only
moves the points along the loop. For an \eqv\ the points
are stationary in time; for \reqv\ they move in time, but in
either case, the loop remains invariant.
So we do not have the problem that we encounter in the Fourier
representation, where seen from the frame of one of the \eqva\
the rest trace out circles under the action of continuous symmetry
translations.


\subsection{Stability of \eqva}
\label{s:StabEqui}
%%
% Predrag           5jun2005

If $u_\stagn(x)$ is an \eqv\ solution of \KSe,
the {\stabmat}
${\Mvar}={\Mvar}(a_\stagn)$
is constant in time,
and
the {\jacobianM}
of the \eqv\ solution is
\beq
 \jMps^t(a_\stagn) = e^{{\Mvar} t}
    \,,\qquad
 \Mvar_{ij}= \Mvar_{ij}(a_\stagn)
\,.
\ee{eqvFundMat}
Calculation of the {\stabmat} requires a bit of care:
% \refeq{DerMatrix}
$a_{k}$ cannot be varied independently of $a_{-k}$, as
% \refeq{expan}
the reality of $u(x,t)$ implies that $a_{k}=a^*_{-k}$.
We impose the reality constraint by splitting \refeq{expan}
in real and imaginary parts, $a_k=b_k+i\, c_k$. {\Stabmat}
is then:
% \index{Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system}
\bea
    \frac{\partial \dot{c}_k}{\partial c_{j}} & = &
    q_k^2\left(1- q_k^2 \right)\delta_{kj}
    - q_k (c_{k+j}-c_{k-j})
\continue
    \frac{\partial \dot{c}_k}{\partial b_{j}} & = &
    - q_k ( b_{k+j}+b_{k-j} )
\label{expanMvar}\\
    \frac{\partial \dot{b}_k}{\partial b_{j}} & = &
    q_k^2\left(1- q_k^2 \right)\delta_{kj}
    +  q_k (c_{k+j} + c_{k-j})
\continue
    \frac{\partial \dot{b}_k}{\partial c_{j}} & = &
    - q_k (b_{k+j}-b_{k-j})
    \,,\qquad  k,j>0
\,,
\nnu
\eea
where $q_k = k/\tildeL$.
For the \KSe\ the constant solution $u(x,t)=0$ with zero energy $E$ is an
\eqv\ point of \refeq{ks} which we shall henceforth refer to as
\EQV{0}. For this `laminar' \eqv\ the {\stabmat}
is diagonal, and
so is the {\jacobianM}
$
\jMps^t_{kj}(0) = \delta_{kj} e^{(q_k^2- q_k^4)t}
\,.
$

From \refeq{expan} we see that the origin $u(x,t) = 0$
has Fourier modes as the linear stability eigenvectors.
The $|k|<\tildeL$
long wavelength perturbations of the flat-front {\eqv}
are linearly unstable, while all
$|k|> \tildeL$ short wavelength perturbations are strongly contractive.
The high $k$ eigenvalues, corresponding to rapid variations of
the flame front, decay so fast that the corresponding eigendirections
are physically irrelevant.
The most unstable mode, nearest to $|k|=\tildeL/\sqrt{2}$,
sets the scale of the mean wavelength $\sqrt{2}$
of the KS `turbulent' dynamics,
% measured in the system size \tildeL,

\subsection{\Rpo s, symmetries and \po s} \label{sec:KSePO}
% Predrag created file              jul 3 2006

The KS equation \refeq{ks} is time translationally invariant,
and space translationally invariant
under the 1-$d$ Lie group of $O(2)$ rotations: if
$u(x,t)$ is a solution, then $u(x+\shift,t)$ and
$-u(-x+\shift,t)$ are equivalent
solutions for any $-L/2 < \shift \leq L/2$.
As a result, KS can have
%\reqva\ (traveling wave) solutions $u(x-ct)$ and
\rpo\ solutions with period $\period{}$ and
a nonzero shift $\shift$, without or with reflection,
\beq
u(x+\shift,\period{}) = u(x,0)
\,,\qquad \mbox{or } \quad
-u(-x+\shift,\period{}) = u(x,0)
\,,
\ee{KSrpos}
\ie, a profile $u(x,0)$ that occurs again after time $\period{}$,
but shifted by $\shift$, and possibly reflected by $\Refl$.
{\Rpo s} are periodic in $c=\shift/\period{}$
co-rotating frame,
but in the stationary frame their trajectories
are quasiperiodic.
Due to the reflection symmetry \refeq{KSparity} of KS equation,
every {\rpo}
$u(x,t)$ with shift $\shift$ has a symmetric partner
$-u(-x,t)$ with shift $-\shift$.

Our search for \rpo s in KS system was
inspired by Vanessa L{\'o}pez\rf{lop05rel} investigation
of {\rpo s} of the Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation.
However, there is a vast literature on
{\rpo s} since their first appearance,
in  Poincar\'e study of
the 3-body problem\rf{ChencinerLink,rtb},
where the Lagrange points are the \reqva.
They arise in dynamics of systems
with continuous symmetries, such as motions of rigid bodies, gravitational
$N$-body problems, molecules and nonlinear waves.
Very recently Viswanath\rf{Visw07b} % arXiv.org/physics/0604062
has found both \reqva\ and \rpo s in the plane Couette problem.

% \subsection{Discrete symmetries imply \po s}

As $\shift$ is continuous in the interval $[-L/2, L/2]$,
the likelihood of a $\shift=0$ shift is zero,
unless an exact periodicity is enforced by a discrete symmetry,
such as the dihedral symmetries discussed above.
If the shift $\shift$ of a \rpo\ with period $\period{}$ is such
that $\shift /L$ is a rational number, then the orbit is
periodic with period $n\period{}$.
Due to the KS equation invariance
under reflection \refeq{KSparity},
two types of \po s are possible:

{\bf (a)} The \po\ lies within the  $\bbU^+$ antisymmetric subspace
$-u(-x,0) = u(x,0)$ and $u(x,\period{}) = u(x,0)$.

{\bf (b)} The \rpo\ in \refeq{KSrpos} is of  reflection type
$\Refl\tau_{\shift/L} u(x,\period{}) = u(x,0)$.
%    \RLD{
%    Maybe we should use symmetry operators throughout the discussion?
%The general idea is that in chaotic systems with symmetries we should
%generalize the notion of a periodic solution from $u(\period{}) = u(0)$
%to $u(\period{}) = {\bf S} u(0)$, where ${\bf S}$ is any symmetry
%a solution of the system might posses.
%\\
%PC: good idea
%    }
In the next period $\period{}$ such orbit
reverses its drift,
$\Refl\tau_{\shift/L} u(-x-\shift,2\period{}) = u(x,0)$, and any
shift acquired during time $0$ to
$\period{}$ is compensated by the opposite shift during
evolution from $\period{}$ to $2\period{}$.
%\[
%u(x,\period{}) = \Refl u(x,\period{}/2) =
%   \Refl^2 u(x,0) = u(x,0)

\Po s built from repetitions of such shorter segments
are encountered in dynamical systems with discrete
symmetries\rf{CvitaEckardt,DasBuch}.

In physical settings where the observation times are much longer than
the dynamical `turnover' and Lyapunov times (statistical mechanics,
quantum physics, turbulence) periodic orbit theory\rf{DasBuch} provides
highly accurate predictions of measurable long-time averages such as
the turbulent drag\rf{GHCW07}. Physical predictions have to be
independent of a particular choice of ODE representation of the PDE
under consideration and, most importantly, invariant under all
symmetries of the dynamics. In this section we discuss a set of such
physical observables for the  1-$d$ KS invariant under reflections and
translations. They offer a representation of dynamics in which the
symmetries are explicitly quotiented out. We illustrate  this in
\refsect{sec:energyL22} by projecting a set of explicit solutions on
these coordinates.

The {space average} of a function $\obser = \obser(\pSpace,t)$  on
the interval $L$,
\beq
    \expct{\obser} = \Lint{\pSpace}\, \obser(\pSpace,t)
    % \expct{\obser} = \frac{1}{L}\int_0^{L} d\pSpace\, \obser(\pSpace,t)
    \,,
    \label{rpo:spac_ave}
\eeq
is in general time dependent.
Its mean value is given by the {time average}
\beq
\timeAver{\obser}
    =
\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t \! d\tau \, \expct{\obser}
    =
\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t \!
    \Lint{\tau}  d\pSpace\, \obser(\pSpace,\tau)
    \,.
\label{rpo:tim_ave}
\eeq
The mean value
% $\timeAver{\obser}$,
of $\obser = \obser(u_\stagn) \equiv \obser_\stagn$ evaluated on $q$
\eqv\ or {\reqv} $u(\pSpace,t) = u_\stagn(\pSpace-ct)$ is
\beq
%         \obser_\stagn = \timeAver{\obser}_\stagn = \expct{\obser}_\stagn
\timeAver{\obser}_\stagn = \expct{\obser}_\stagn = \obser_\stagn\,.
\label{rpo:u-eqv} \eeq Evaluation of the infinite time average
\refeq{rpo:tim_ave} on a function of a \po\ or \rpo\
$u_p(\pSpace,t)=u_p(\pSpace,t+\period{p})$ requires only a single
$\period{p}$ traversal,
\beq
  \timeAver{\obser}_p = \frac{1}{\period{p}}
    \int_0^{\period{p}} \! d\tau \, \expct{\obser}
\,.
\label{rpo:u-cyc}
\eeq

Equation \refeq{ks} can be written as % in ``potential'' form
\beq
    u_t=- V_x
        \,,\qquad
    V(x,t)={\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}u^2+u_{x} + u_{xxx}
    \,.
\ee{ksPotent} If $u$ is `flame-front velocity' then \expctE, defined in
\refeq{eq:stdks}, can be interpreted as the mean energy density.
% \refeq{ksEnergy}.
%
So, even though KS is a phenomenological
small-amplitude equation, the time-dependent quantity
\beq
    \expctE=
%\frac{1}{L}\int_0^{L} \!dx \,
  \Lint{\pSpace}
  V(x,t)=
%\frac{1}{L}\int_0^{L}\! dx \,
  \Lint{\pSpace} \frac{u^2}{2}
  \label{ksEnergy} \eeq
has a physical interpretation\rf{ksgreene88} as the average `energy'
density of the flame front. This analogy to the mean kinetic energy
density for the Navier-Stokes motivates what follows.

The energy \refeq{ksEnergy} is intrinsic to
the flow, independent of the particular ODE basis set
chosen to represent the PDE. However, as the Fourier
amplitudes are eigenvectors of the translation operator,
in the Fourier space the energy is a diagonalized
quadratic norm,
\beq
\expctE   % = (u,u)
          =  \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} E_k
\,,\qquad
E_k = % a_{-k} a_k =
    {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}|a_k|^2
\,,
\ee{EFourier}
and explicitly invariant term by term
under translations %\refeq{eq:RPOcondFouri
\refeq{eq:shiftFour}
and reflections \refeq{KSparity}.

Take time derivative of the energy density \refeq{ksEnergy},
substitute \refeq{ks} and integrate by parts. Total derivatives vanish
by the spatial periodicity on the $L$ domain:
\bea
   \dot{\expctE} &=&
     \expct{u_t \, u}
    % \frac{1}{L}\int_0^{L}u \, u_t\, dx
     = - \expct{\left({u^2}/{2} + u \, u_{x} + u \, u_{xxx}\right)_x u }
    \continue
    &=&
\expct{ u_x \, {u^2}/{2} + u_{x}{}^2 + u_x \, u_{xxx}}
    \,.
\label{rpo:ksErate}
\eea
The first term in \refeq{rpo:ksErate} vanishes by
integration by parts,
\(
3 \expct{ u_x \, u^2}= \expct{(u^3)_x} = 0
\,,
\) % {EnNonl0}
and integrating the third term by parts yet again
one gets\rf{ksgreene88} that the energy variation
\beq
   \dot{\expctE} = P - D
                \,,\qquad
      P =  \expct{u_{x}{}^2}
                \,,\quad
      D =  \expct{u_{xx}{}^2}
\ee{EnRate}
balances the power $P$ pumped in by anti-diffusion $u_{xx}$
against the energy dissipation rate $D$
by hyper-viscosity $u_{xxxx}$
in the KS equation \refeq{ks}.

The time averaged energy density  $\timeAver{E}$
computed on a typical orbit goes to a constant, so
the expectation values \refeq{rpo:EtimAve} of drive and dissipation
exactly balance each out:
\beq
    \timeAver{\dot{E}}  =
    \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}
        \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t d\tau \, \dot{\expctE}
=
      \timeAver{P} - \timeAver{D}
%       \timeAver{(u_{x})^2} - \timeAver{(u_{xx})^2}
= 0
    \,.
\ee{rpo:EtimAve}
In particular, the \eqva\
and \reqva\ fall onto the diagonal in \reffig{f:drivedrag},
and so do time averages computed on \po s and \rpo s:
\beq
\timeAver{E}_p =
\frac{1}{\period{p}} \int_0^\period{p}d\tau \, E(\tau)
    \,,\qquad
\timeAver{P}_p =
\frac{1}{\period{p}} \int_0^\period{p} d\tau \, P(\tau)
    =
      \timeAver{D}_p
    \,.
\label{poE}
\eeq
In the Fourier basis \refeq{EFourier} the conservation of energy on average
takes form
\beq
0 = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} ( q_k^2 - q_k^4 )\,
    \timeAver{E}_k
\,,\qquad
E_k(t) =  {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} |a_k(t)|^2
\,.
\ee{EFourier1}
The large $k$ convergence of this series is insensitive to the
system size $L$; $\timeAver{E_k}$ have to decrease much faster than
$q_k^{-4}$.
