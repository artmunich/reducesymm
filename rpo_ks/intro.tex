\section{Introduction}

Recent experimental and theoretical advances\rf{science04}
support a dynamical vision
of turbulence:
% ascribed to E.~Hopf:
%, as a walk through
% a repertoire of unstable recurrent patterns:
As a turbulent flow evolves,
every so often we catch a glimpse of a familiar pattern.
For any finite  spatial resolution,
the system follows approximately for a finite time 
a pattern belonging to a 
{ finite alphabet}
of admissible patterns.
The long term dynamics is
a {  walk through the space of these unstable patterns}.
The question is how to characterize and classify such patterns?
Here we follow the seminal Hopf\rf{hopf48} paper, and  visualize
turbulence not as  a sequence of 
spatial snapshots in turbulent evolution,
% with each pixel a 3-$d$ velocity field
but as a trajectory in an 
 $\infty$-$d$ state space in which an
instant in turbulent evolution is
a { unique} point. In E.~Hopf's vision, 
theory of turbulence for a given system, with given boundary conditions,
is given by the
(a) geometry of the state space and (b) the associated natural measure, 
\ie,
the likelihood that asymptotic dynamics visits a given state space region.

We explore Hopf's vision in context of
the \KSe\rf{ku,siv}.
Such 
amplitude equations for interfacial instabilities arise in a variety
of contexts\rf{KNSks90} - and 
the \KS\ system is perhaps the
simplest physically interesting spatially extended nonlinear system.

Holmes, Lumley
and Berkooz\rf{Holmes96} offer a delightful discussion of why this system
deserves study as a staging ground for studying turbulence in 
full-fledged Navier-Stokes boundary shear flows. 
% \refRefs{MS66,Christiansen:97} have proposed (in contexts
% much simpler than the full Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics) 
% that the unstable spatiotemporally periodic
% solutions could play that role.
The unstable periodic solutions of
this system have been studied in great detail%
% by Christiansen {\em et al.}
\rf{Christiansen:97,Lan:Thesis,lanCvit06}
in the antisymmetric subspace of the \KS\ dynamics.

The focus here is on the role continuous symmetries
play in spatiotemporal dynamics. For the 1-$D$ \KS\ on a periodic domain
the symmetry group is the group of all translations, and
any solution (let us say, an \eqv) belongs to a circle of equivalent
solutions. The notion of exact periodicity is 
replaced by the notion of relative periodicity, and,
as we shall see, 
\reqva\ and \rpo s here play the role of \eqva\ and
\po s of the earlier studies. 

Here, continuing on the detailed analysis of
\refrefs{KNSks90,ksgreene88}, we undertake a detailed study of the 
\KS\ \eqva\ and \reqva\ stable/unstable manifolds
for a system sufficiently large to exhibit many of
the features typical of turbulent dynamics observed in large \KS\ systems.
We also determine a large number of \rpo s, setting the
stage for their systematic enumeration and application 
of the periodic orbit theory.
