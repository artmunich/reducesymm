\rpo s of this paper seem to be all of fintie symmetry group type, ie they are
all eventually periodic.

Relative equilibria are orbits of the symmetry group action which are invariant under the flow.

Relative periodic orbits (RPOs for short) are the analogous of relative equilibria concerning periodic orbits,
this corresponds here to motions which are periodic in a steadily rotating frame
(a precise definition is given in Section \ref{methode}).

Let $F_t$ the flow of $X_H$. A point $p\in\p$ is said to be \emph{periodic} if there exists a
constant $T>0$ such that for all time $t$, $F_{t+T}(p)=F_t(p)$. The \emph{period} is the smallest
$T>0$ which satisfies that condition. The set $\gamma=\{F_t(p)\mid t\in\R\}$ is called a
\emph{periodic orbit}. Every point of $\gamma$ is periodic with the same period, hence we can
define \emph{the} period of a periodic orbit.


A point $p\in\p$ is said to be a \emph{relative periodic point} if there exist $g\in G^o$ and
$T>0$ such that $F_{t+T}(p)=g\cdot F_t(p)$ for all time $t$. The set $\gamma=\{F_t(p)\mid
t\in\R\}$ is called a \emph{relative periodic orbit} (RPO), and every point of $\gamma$ is a relative
periodic point. In particular, a periodic orbit which is not a \eq is a RPO. 

Note that there exist
other equivalent definitions of a relative periodic orbit \cite{Or98}.

Typically a RPO is a solution which, in a suitably moving frame, looks time-periodic.
