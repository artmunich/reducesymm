\item[2012-02-19 Dan Goldman]
Please read the two Shapere-Wilczek papers\rf{ShWi87,ShWi06} on the
geometric approach to low Re swimming, and the engineering paper from my
CMU colleagues Hatton and Choset\rf{HaCho10} (click
\HREF{http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/Web/People/biorobotics/papers/DSCC2010_Hatton_Choset.pdf}
{here}). We have a paper in submission to PNAS (we are answering some
reviews) which applies these methods to a granular 3 link swimmer,
despite the fact that we don't have an equivalent of NS equations for
granular media. Using our empirical granular drag laws, the CMU guys
predict the optimal forward and turning movements for a 3-link swimmer to
10\% even at high joint angular excursions. I'm presently refining the
paper and making it readable (a reviewer complaint) and I'll send it
along once I do so.

I could really use a physicist to help interpret and help us (me + CMU
guys) take the next step.


\item[2012-02-19 Predrag] It's pretty impressive, the first
announcement\rf{ShWi87,ShWi89} in 1987, the long version\rf{ShWi06} in
2006. {\em J. Fluid. Mech.} decided it might be good enough once Wilczek
got Nobel Prize?
Perhaps Koiller, Ehlers, and Montgomery\rf{KoEhlMo96} review is helpful?
Or \refref{ShWi89a,DeArKo04}?

If you are asking if I can solve their problem, the answer is ``Yes'', I
am sort of an expert on this sort of thing! I have a paper\rf{HuKoYa11}
{\em Micro-swimmers with hydrodynamic interactions} on precisely this
topic. Here is the abstract and a

{link} (or

Abstract:  The low-Reynolds-number motions of Purcell's three-link
swimmer, and of a closely related two-paddle swimmer, are investigated
and compared using slender-body theory and resistive-force theory. The
results are compared (in the case of the three-link swimmer) with the
resistive-force calculations of Becker, Koehler and Stone\rf{BeKoSt03}
(BKS). In particular, we examine the effect of hydrodynamic interaction
and slenderness on the displacement and efficiency of the swimmers. The
BKS analysis is, for the most part, confirmed and extended. However,
deviations of up to 43\% are found in cases where the swimmer propels
itself with large stroke angles. Finally, we discuss recent experimental
data in light of our numerical results.

Also, there is our PRL on Spiroplasma\rf{YaWoHu09} which has some
similarities to a three-link swimmer (click

{McLachlan} \etal\rf{McLPerlQui03} write in
{\em Lie group foliations: dynamical systems and integrators}
(I added it to Zotero): ``
Foliate systems are those which preserve some (possibly
singular) foliation of phase space, such as systems with integrals,
systems with continuous symmetries, and skew product systems. We study
numerical integrators which also preserve the foliation. The case in
which the foliation is given by the orbits of an action of a Lie group
has a particularly nice structure, which we study in detail, giving
conditions under which all foliate vector fields can be written as the
sum of a vector field tangent to the orbits and a vector field invariant
under the group action. This allows the application of many techniques of
geometric integration, including splitting methods and Lie group
integrators.

In \emph{Heteroclinic orbits in a spherically invariant system}
Armbruster and Chossat\rf{ArCho91} look at some bifurcations with
\On{3}-symmetry, might be a model to try slicing on in a non-abelian
setting.

\item[2012-05-16  Parameswaran Nair]  vpnair@optonline.net writes
on saddle solutions of Yang-Mills:

I attributed the conjecture to Hitchin; it was actually due to Atiyah and
Jones. "The only finite action solutions of the YM equations are
instantons, either self-dual or antiself-dual." This was the conjecture
for which the refs provide counter examples.

\HREF{http://ChaosBook.org/library/Schiff91.pdf}{Here is} the paper by my
student Schiff\rf{Schiff91}, who writes:
``
Following a proposal of Burzlaff (Phys.Rev.D 24 (1981) 546), we find
solutions of the classical equations of motion of an abelian Higgs model
on hyperbolic space, and thereby obtain a series of non-self-dual
classical solutions of four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory. The lowest
value of the action for these solutions is roughly 3.3 times the standard
instanton action.
''

``
In physics, despite the fact that the non-self-dual solutions correspond
to saddle points, and not minima, of the Yang-Mills functional, to do a
correct semiclassical approximation by a saddle-point evaluation of the
path integral, it is certainly necessary to include a contribution due to
nonself-dual solutions, and if it should be the case that there is a
non-self-dual solution with action lower than the instanton action (this
question is currently open, and of substantial importance), then such a
contribution would even dominate. Unfortunately, it is questionable
whether the semiclassical approximation can give a reliable picture of
quantized gauge theories; it has been argued that in four-dimensional
gauge theory small quantum fluctuations
around classical solutions cannot be responsible for
confinement, unlike in certain lower-dimensional
theories. But it may still be possible to extract some
physics from the semiclassical approach. A first step in
such a direction would be to obtain a good understanding
of the full set of non-self-dual solutions and their properties.
[...] We pursue an old idea, due to Burzlaft
[10], for obtaining a non-self-dual, "cylindrically symmetric"
solution for gauge group SU(3). If we write
$\reals^4 = \reals \times \reals^3$, and identify some SU(2) [or SO(3)] subgroup
of SU(3), with generators that we will denote T', then we
can look at the set of SU(3) gauge potentials which are invariant
under the action of the group generated by the
sum of the T"s and the generators of rotations on the IR
factor of E (we choose the T"s and the IR rotation generators
to satisfy the same commutation relations). We
call such potentials "cylindrically symmetric" (in analogy
to the standard notion of cylindrical symmetry in IR,
which involves writing R =RXIR and requiring rotational
symmetry on the E factor). Such potentials will
be specified by a number of functions of two variables:
the coordinate on the IR factor of E (which we will
denote x), and the radial coordinate of the E factor
(which we will denote y). Clearly the equations of motion
for such cylindrically symmetric potentials (if they are
consistent) will reduce to equations on the space
I (x,y ):y ~ 0].

The earlier work is by Sibner, Sibner, Uhlenbeck\rf{SiSiUhl89}. They
write ``
The Yang-Mills functional for connections on principle SU(2) bundles over
S 4 is studied. Critical points of the functional satisfy a system of
second-order partial differential equations, the Yang-Mills equations. If,
in particular, the critical point is a minimum, it satisfies a
first-order system, the self-dual or anti-self-dual equations. Here, we
exhibit an infinite number of finite-action non-minimal unstable critical
points. They are obtained by constructing a topologically nontrivial loop
of connections to which min-max theory is applied. The construction
exploits the fundamental relationship between certain invariant
instantons on S 4 and magnetic monopoles on H 3. This result settles a
question in gauge field theory that has been open for many years.

Bor\rf{Bor92} writes
``
We prove the existence of a new family of non-self-dual finite-energy
solutions to the Yang-Mills equations on Euclidean four-space, with SU(2)
as a gauge group. The approach is that of ``equivariant geometry:''
attention is restricted to a special class of fields, those that satisfy
a certain kind of rotational symmetry, for which it is proved that (1) a
solution to the Yang-Mills equations exists among them; and (2) no
solution to the self-duality equations exists among them. The first
assertion is proved by an application of the direct method of the
calculus of variations (existence and regularity of minimizers), and the
second assertion by studying the symmetry properties of the linearized
self-duality equations. The same technique yields a new family of
non-self-dual solutions on the complex projective plane.

{\it Geometrical phases from global gauge invariance of nonlinear classical field theories},
by Garrison and Chiao\rf{GaChi88}.

\item[2012-05-20 Jeff Greensite] has written a book\rf{Greensite11} of possible interest,
\emph{An introduction to the confinement problem}.

\HREF{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gribov_ambiguity}{Gribov ambiguity wiki}:
``
In gauge theory, especially in non-abelian gauge theories, we often
encounter global problems when gauge fixing. Gauge fixing means choosing
a representative from each gauge orbit. The space of representatives is a
submanifold and represents the gauge fixing condition. Ideally, every
gauge orbit will intersect this submanifold once and only once.
Unfortunately, this is often impossible globally for non-abelian gauge
theories because of topological obstructions and the best that can be
done is make this condition true locally. A gauge fixing submanifold may
not intersect a gauge orbit at all or it may intersect it more than once.
This is called a Gribov\rf{Gribov77} ambiguity.

Gribov ambiguities lead to a nonperturbative failure of the BRST
symmetry, among other things.

A way to resolve the problem of Gribov ambiguity is to restrict the
relevant functional integrals to a single \emph{Gribov region} whose
boundary is called a \emph{Gribov horizon}.
