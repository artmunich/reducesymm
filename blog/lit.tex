\item[2012-02-19 Dan Goldman]
Please read the two Shapere-Wilczek papers\rf{ShWi87,ShWi06} on the
geometric approach to low Re swimming, and the engineering paper from my
CMU colleagues Hatton and Choset\rf{HaCho10} (click
\HREF{http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/Web/People/biorobotics/papers/DSCC2010_Hatton_Choset.pdf}
{here}). We have a paper in submission to PNAS (we are answering some
reviews) which applies these methods to a granular 3 link swimmer,
despite the fact that we don't have an equivalent of NS equations for
granular media. Using our empirical granular drag laws, the CMU guys
predict the optimal forward and turning movements for a 3-link swimmer to
10\% even at high joint angular excursions. I'm presently refining the
paper and making it readable (a reviewer complaint) and I'll send it
along once I do so.

I could really use a physicist to help interpret and help us (me + CMU
guys) take the next step.


\item[2012-02-19 Predrag] It's pretty impressive, the first
announcement\rf{ShWi87,ShWi89} in 1987, the long version\rf{ShWi06} in
2006. {\em J. Fluid. Mech.} decided it might be good enough once Wilczek
got Nobel Prize?
Perhaps Koiller, Ehlers, and Montgomery\rf{KoEhlMo96} review is helpful?
Or \refref{ShWi89a,DeArKo04,BeKoSt03}?
