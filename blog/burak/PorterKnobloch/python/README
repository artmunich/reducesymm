This is a python implementation of the twomode system.

Program structure is based on the "recipe" described here:
http://wiki.scipy.org/Cookbook/CoupledSpringMassSystem

code/twomode.py holds the functions that are specific to the twomode system
such as velocity etc.

DEBIAN.sh, FEDORA.sh, GENTOO.sh scripts contains the installation instructions
of required packages for respective linux distributions. You need them in order
to run the python programmes here. (I'm assumming that you already have a 
python installation, which is a default thing with the modern linux distros.)

FOR WINDOWS USERS: The following are two python implementations that has
scipy stack in it: 
Anaconda - http://continuum.io/downloads 
winpython - http://code.google.com/p/winpython/

However, running scripts here are bash scripts, so you may need to translate
them in order to be able to run on windows. Plotters, however, should be 
runnable directly once you generate the data.
