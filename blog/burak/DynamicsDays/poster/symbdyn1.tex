Relative periodic orbits (trajectories of points $x_p$ which after a finite
time $T$ intersects the group orbit $\mathcal{M}_{x_p}$ of $x_p$) in the 
symmetry equivariant state space become periodic orbits in the symmetry reduced 
state space. In order to find them, we choose a Poincar\'e section in the
reduced state space (Figure 2, 3) and construct the return map of the arclengths
(Figure 4) of the points on the Poincar\'e section curve shown in Figure 3.

We position the Poincar\'e section plane such that it includes the relative
equilibrium $\hat{x}_{TW}$ of the system and the direction towards which the 
nearby perturbations expand which we find by examining the eigenvectors of 
the matrix of reduced velocity gradients ($\hat{A}_{i,j} = \partial_i \hat{v}(\hat{x}_{TW})_j$).
