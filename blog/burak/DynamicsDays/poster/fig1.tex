\textbf{\textsc{Fig 1}} A 3D projection of the slice hyperplane and three
group orbits of the Porter-Knobloch system. Group tangents evaluated at the
points of intersection are drawn as red arrows. Note that the perpendicular
component of the group tangent becomes smaller as the relative magnitude of 
the second mode with respect to the first mode increases.}
