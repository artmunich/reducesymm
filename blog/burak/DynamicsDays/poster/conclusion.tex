We introduced a simple four dimensional system that exhibits chaos and is 
equivariant under continuous SO(2) transformations.
\newline

\noindent
We showed that the method of slices can be used to reduce the SO(2) symmetry
and it is particularly easy to apply to the case at hand since a single hyperplane
captures all the group orbits that has a component in the first mode.
\newline

\noindent
We found relative periodic orbits of the system by constructing a Poincar\'e 
return map in the reduced state space.
