Fixed points of the Poincar\'e return map in Figure 4 and its higher iterates 
correspond to the relative periodic orbits of the Porter-Knobloch system. We 
take the fixed points that we get from interpolations to the return map as 
initial guesses and run Newton solvers to find the relative periodic orbits 
of the flow. We plotted two such orbits in the reduced state space in Figure 5.
