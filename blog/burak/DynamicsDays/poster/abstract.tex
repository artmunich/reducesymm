We study a 4-dimensional ODE normal form that is equivariant under SO(2)
transformations as a simple system that posess a continuous symmetry and
can exhibit chaos. We apply the method of slices to reduce the SO(2) symmetry,
and construct Poincar\'e return maps on the slice manifold which enables 
us to find the relative periodic orbits.
