I have added this chapter to collect your ChaosBook.org edits /
comments. If you svn co dasbuch, you have the dasbuch/book/chapter/*.tex
source code and can clip and paste formulas to here. I never refer to a
chapter by its current number, as chapter numbers change from edition to
edition - latter on (years hence) trying to figure out what ``Chapter
17'' is can be quite confusing. Internally, each chapter is kept track
off by its file name, for example, in this blog ``continuous'' refers to
\refchap{c-continuous} {\em Relativity for cyclists}.

\item[2012-10-12 PC]                     \toCB
Now, I'm just curious - here is blah blah from my blog:

% \item[2012-08-12 PC]
Georgiou, Dettmann and Altmann\rf{GeDeAl12}
\emph{Faster than expected escape for a class of fully chaotic maps},
\arXiv{1207.7000}, have a potentially interesting trace formula. Am I
minced meat? Remind them to cite ChaosBook.org. Funny thing is, Dettmann
is a contributor to it. Is he ashamed of his youthful digressions?

%\item[2012-10-10 Predrag]
For a theorist like me, Avlund et al.\rf{AEOGS10} experimental / theoretical
paper
\emph{Observation of periodic orbits on curved two-dimensional geometries}
is a remarkable achievement. One author is my former PhD student, three
others are my collaborators. The first sentence of the paper says
``semiclassics, in particular, periodic orbit theory, provides a powerful
connection to the dynamics of the analogous classical system [1-4].'' Of
the four textbooks cited, one is on periodic orbit theory. What is this
fear of ChaosBook.org? Am I minced meat? Do I have advanced halitosis? I
understand that the co-authors of the ChaosBook.org have not read it, but
they have not read the other four books that they cite either. Can
somebody explain to me where ChaosBook.org falls short?

\item[2012-10-12 Mark Oxborrow] re. ``Predrag is from pleistocene:''
Why? I've read your ``why a web book'' which make many valid and
important points. But here is me thinking off the top of my head.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
People are just plain conservative, stuck in their ways, and slow to
catch on.  To misquote Planck: ``A new form of publishing does not
triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but
rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows
up that is familiar with it.''
    \item
When writing a traditionally published paper, the inevitably out-of-date
``style guide'' handed out by the relevant publisher fails to instruct on
how, exactly, a reference to a web-based resource should be formatted.
There are quite a few permutations and combinations to consider. ``PRL
78, 567 (2007)'' is in contrast a canonical no-brainer but doing the same
for a web resource takes more effort and one is always worried that some
pedant of a copy editor at the journal will slow one's publication down
by a month by nit-picking at one's non-standard formatting of web book
references.
    \item
With respect to the last point made in ``why a web book'', authors like
citing things that are set in stone. It's about control and security. An
authors feels uneasy about citing an evolving book because one does not
quite know what it will look like when the reader of one's paper chases
down the reference to said book four-and-a-half years' time.  The cited
web-resource may have become hacked and taken over by the Moonies in the
interim.  Ironically, authors feel that citing traditional
published-on-paper references Is way of future proofing their work.
\end{enumerate}
But all in all. I think it's just plain boring conservatism. Attitudes
and behaviours will change in time. Slowly. When Elsevier, Taylor and
Francis, or even the IOP get taken over by the Moonies, authors will
realize that paper was not so permanent after all.

\item[2013-03-27 PC] Had to give up on
this text in my focusPOTty article. Maybe can use it in
ChaosBook?:

Poincar\'e speculated that
% \APWedit{intrinsically nonlinear}
% PC - citing him - he did not say 'intrinsically nonlinear'
\po s offer ``a breach into a domain
hitherto reputed unreachable,'' but it took 80 years before one could
compute such orbits. The answer was that one has to evaluate a
determinant (Zeta function) and take a logarithm (trace formula),
but the determinant is fashioned out of infinitely many infinitely small pieces.
In the 1960's the pieces were counted, and in the 1970's they were
weighted and assembled in a fashion that in beauty and in depth ranks
along with thermodynamics, partition functions and path integrals
amongst the crown jewels of theoretical physics.
With his trace
formula, \cite{gutbook} was the first to demonstrate that chaotic
dynamics is built upon unstable periodic orbits. \cite{ruelle}
derived the {\dzeta}, in which the natural measure is a weighted sum
over the infinite set of unstable \po s. The Copenhagen school
\citep{DasBuch} turned these formulas into computation, and by 1991
the group of D.~Wintgen could obtain a surprisingly accurate helium
spectrum from a small set of \po s \citep{ERTW91}, 50 years after old
quantum theory had failed to do so. A tour de force, but 3 ODEs are
still a far cry from $\infty$\dmn\ statesp\ of fluid dynamics.

\item[2012-01-02 PC]
Haddad\rf{HaCh08} says:                     \toCB

A dynamical system consists of three elements -- namely, a setting (called
the state space) in which the dynamical behavior takes place, such as a
torus, topological space, manifold, or locally compact metric space; a
mathematical rule or dynamic which specifies the evolution of the system
over time; and an initial condition or state from which the system starts
at some initial time.

\item[2013-02-26 PC]                \toCB
Proposal: First, explain difference between Floquet multipliers and
stretching rates for an explicit 3\dmn example. Second, show the
relation to Lyapunov exponents by looking at the infinite repeat of a
cycle. Prove that the leading Floquet exponent goes into the leading
Lyapunov exponent. Is it true for the rest of the spectrum?

\section{Chapter: Cycle stability}
\label{c-invariants}\noindent dasbuch/book/chapter/invariants.tex
\begin{description}

\item[2011-04-05 CS] A question about the last sentence in the first
paragraph of Section 5.4  discussed in the group study last week: Why
does the neighborhood size scale as $1/|\Lambda_{p}|$? Wouldn't it scale
as $|\Lambda_{p}|$?

\item[2011-04-06 PC] Mhm, clearly not written clearly enough, but perhaps
the most important property of an unstable flow that one has to
understand. The product of expanding multipliers $|\Lambda_{p}|$ blows up
exponentially with time, but the \emph{neighborhood shrinks}
exponentially with time, Detroit-like. Does looking at Figure 5.1 help?
Does reading Sect. 1.5.1 help? If you understand it, can you rewrite

                                                    \toCB
``
Nearby points aligned along the stable (contracting) directions  remain
in the neighborhood of the trajectory $\ssp(t)= \flow{t}{\xInit}$; the
ones to keep an eye on are the points which leave the neighborhood along
the unstable directions because all nonlinear phenomena comes from these
directions. The sub-volume $ |\pS_{\xInit}| = \prod_i^e\Delta \ssp_i$ of
the set of points which get no further away from $\flow{t}{\xInit}$ than
$L$, the typical size of the system, is fixed by the condition that
$\Delta \ssp_i \ExpaEig_i = O(L)$ in each expanding direction $i$. Hence
the neighborhood size scales as $|\pS_{\xInit}| \propto
O(L^{d_e})/|\ExpaEig_p| \propto 1/|\ExpaEig_p| $ where $\ExpaEig_p$ is
the product of expanding Floquet multipliers
(5.7) %\refeq{expVol}
only; contracting ones play a secondary role.
''

so it makes sense to you. If you and Adam do not understand it, then
bring it up for discussion in the study group.

\item[2011-04-11 CS]
rewrote Paragraph 1 of Section 5.4 as follows:

\CSedit{
Nearby points aligned along the stable (contracting) directions  remain
in the neighborhood of the trajectory $\ssp(t)= \flow{t}{\xInit}$; the
ones to keep an eye on are the points which leave the neighborhood along
the unstable directions because almost all nonlinear and chaotic
phenomena comes from these directions. The sub-volume $ |\pS_{\xInit}| =
\prod_i^e\Delta \ssp_i$ of the set of points which get no further away
from $\flow{t}{\xInit}$ than $L$, the typical size of the system, is
fixed by the condition that $\Delta \ssp_i \ExpaEig_i = O(L)$ in each
expanding direction $i$. Hence the neighborhood size scales as
$|\pS_{\xInit}| \propto O(L^{d_e})/|\ExpaEig_p| \propto 1/|\ExpaEig_p| $
where $\ExpaEig_p$ is the product of expanding Floquet multipliers
(5.7) %\refeq{expVol}
only(see section 1.5.1 and figure 1.9 for example);
contracting ones play a secondary role}

\item[2011-04-12 PC] Thanks, I have now rewritten the introduction to the
Chapter as well as the section 5.4 is the spirit you suggest, emphasizing
the key role the concept of 'neighborhood' will play.

\label{c-conjug}\noindent dasbuch/book/chapter/conjug.tex
\begin{description}

\item[2011-04-11 CS]
Finished this Chapter. Generally able to understand it but feel like
there's whole lot more content underneath that as in the KS
transformation for example. There should be a lot tricks and methods to
construct such regularization. And I wonder what kind of singularity
could be regularized. But I guess that this is not an easy question and
should not be the emphasis to my project.


\item[2011-04-11 CS]
A trivial error: eq.~(6.13) should be ``$\sqrt{x}dx = 2dt$'',
rather than ``$\sqrt{x}dx = \sqrt{2}dt$''.

\item[2011-04-12 PC]
No error is 'trivial.' Thanks.

%%-----   Newton
\section{Chapter: Hamiltonian dynamics}
\label{c-newton}\noindent dasbuch/book/chapter/newton.tex
\begin{description}

\item[2012-01-02 CS to PC]
I am wondering how to choose phase space
coordinates? Do phase/state space coordinates have any requirement and
whether conservation of space volume is such a requirement? What's the
meaning of conservation of phase space requirement? In my understanding
in Hamiltonian flows, conservation of phase space volume means
conservation of energy, am I right?

\item[2012-01-02 PC]
Now, it is more subtle than that; time dependent flow can be symplectic,
but energy is not conserved; I think Percival and D.
Richards\rf{PerRich82N} (I have it in the
\HREF{http://www.cns.gatech.edu/CNS-only/LibraryCat2.htm} {CNS library})
discuss that well. Symplectic invariance is \emph{much stronger}
requirement than either either energy conservation or phase-space volume
conservation, see \HREF{http://chaosbook.org/chapters/newton.pdf}
{Section 7.4 Poincar\'e invariants} and
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/chapters/appendStability.pdf} {Appendix D.4
Stability of Hamiltonian flows}: symplectic transformations preserve area
for each $(q,p)$ dual coordinate  pair.

\begin{description}

\item[2011-03-30  CS to PC]
I have a question from the paragraph
following the definition of free action: The splitting of a group
\emph{G} into a stabilizer \emph{$G_{p}$} and \emph{m-1} coset
\emph{$cG_{p}$} relates to an orbit \emph{$M_{p}$} to \emph{m-1} other
distinct orbits \emph{$cM_{p}$}. All of them have equivalent stabilizers,
or more precisely, the points on the same group orbit have
\emph{conjugate stabilizers}: \emph{$G_{cp} = cG_{p}c^{-1}$}. For the
last sentence, does it mean that if \emph{$G_{p}$}  is a stabilizer of
\emph{$M_{p}$}, then \emph{$cG_{p}c^{-1}$} is a stabilizer of
\emph{$cM_{p}$}?

\item[2011-03-31 PC] Yes, you are right. I have now incorporated ``if
\emph{$G_{p}$}  is a stabilizer of \emph{$M_{p}$}, then
\emph{$cG_{p}c^{-1}$} is a stabilizer of \emph{$cM_{p}$}'' into
discrete.tex, thanks.

I intend to excise the dreaded word `stabilizer' from the text, just have
forgotten to do it
\HREF{http://www.flickr.com/photos/birdtracks/4259634492/in/set-72157606259014811/}
{[click]} here. Suggestion - print out the chapter, replace by hand word
`stabilizer' everywhere by 'symmetry' and let's sit together and see
whether the chapter is  easier to read.

\item[2011-04-19 CS]
BTW, any recommendation for a hands on book for Lie group and Lie
algebra? I think I need a deeper knowledge about this.

\item[2011-04-20 PC] I suggested in the siminos/blog/
that you check out a book from the library that Meiss recommends. Do it, see
whether it eases the pain. You can also get
Gilmore and Letellier\rf{GL-Gil07b}
{\em The Symmetry of Chaos} out of the CNS library. It only does the
invariant polynomial reduction (Siminos and I believe that is useless in
higher dimensions), but it is pretty good on discrete symmetries.

I am stuck at trying to understand eq.~(10.16):

 = \sum\limits_{m=0}^{\infty}m^{2}(u_{1}^{(m)2}+u_{2}^{(m)2})
\]
First, why would there be a integral on left hand side? Second, why the
integrand is $(\textbf{T}u(\theta))^{\emph{T}}\textbf{T}u(2\pi-\theta)$?
Shouldn't it be $(\textbf{T}u(\theta))^{\emph{T}}\textbf{T}u(\theta)$
according to eq. (10.11)?

\item[2011-04-20 PC] $u(\theta)$ is a function on the interval $[0,2\pi]$,
hence integral on the left side (LHS). Compact support, hence the infinite sum
on the RHS. If I remember right (check notes or the textbook from
our Math Methods course) for Fourier transforms, a convolution on the
left hand side gives me a product on the right hand side. If I'm wrong,
let me know so I fix this; as you say, does not look like $L^2$ norm...

\item[2013-03-27 PC] Had to give up on
this text in my focusPOTty article. Maybe can use it in
ChaosBook?:

Second, continuous symmetries (rotations and
translations) induce drifts that are the dominant (and obscuring)
feature of turbulence, with \recFlow s predominantly of the relative
(equivariant) kind. \cite{ACHKW11} have shown that only after
\emph{symmetry reduction} are the \statesp\ relations between
important \recFlow s revealed; in particular, it is the geometry of
flows in the symmetry-reduced {\statesp} that enables them to find,
for the first time for pipe flows, relative periodic orbits that are
embedded within the chaotic saddle.
The continuous time symmetry will
have be reduced as well (by Poincar\'e sections) in order to reveal
the \statesp\ geometry of a turbulent flow.

About Example 12.3 H\'enon repeller complete horseshoe:
First, in figure 12.4, why after one step's evolution, point B occupies
point D's original spot and also point C and point D are in the stable

figure out the reason.

\item[2011-07-22 CS] I read the Smale Horseshoe part in Kai's thesis. Now
I understand why the binary sequence has to be assigned this way. Only in
this way can the symbol represent the actual map. It's hard to describe

I had noticed Demidov's website before - you are right, these simulations
are very instructive, I have now added a remark about them to ChaosBook.
He uses a different definition for parameters $a$ and $b$ from H\'enon,
but unfortunately uses the same letters. His definition is natural if one
is interested in Julia sets, but unfortunately not the one H\'enon used,
and I always try to follow the foundational papers, rather than confusing
everybody with sly parameter redefinitions.

Demidov's parametrization\rf{DemChaos} of the H\'enon map is:

    y_{n+1}' &=& x_n'
\,.
\label{DemidHen}

Dividing through by $a'$ we get
\(
\frac{x_{n+1}'}{a'} = 1 + a'\left(\frac{x_n'}{a'}\right)^2 + b'\frac{y_n'}{a'}
\,,
\)
so the two parametrizations are related by:
    \CS{my guess was
\[ %beq
x={x'}/{a'}

a=-{1}/{a'}
\,,\qquad b= {b'}/{a'}

\beq
x={x'}/{a'}
\,,\quad
y={y'}/{a'}
\,;\qquad
a=-{a'}
\,,\quad b= {b'}

You need the transformation between two definitions, if you are
going to use Demidov's simulations to test your ideas, and it helps greatly
if the transformation formula is the correct one. If

In \emph{Estimating long term behavior of flows without trajectory
integration: the infinitesimal generator approach}, \arXiv{1101.4166}
Gary Froyland, Oliver Junge and P\'eter Koltai write:
``
The long-term distributions of trajectories of a flow are described by
invariant densities, i.e. fixed points of an associated transfer
operator. In addition, global slowly mixing structures, such as
almost-invariant sets, which partition phase space into regions that are
almost dynamically disconnected, can also be identified by certain
eigenfunctions of this operator. Indeed, these structures are often hard
to obtain by brute-force trajectory-based analyses. In a wide variety of
applications, transfer operators have proven to be very efficient tools
for an analysis of the global behavior of a dynamical system.
The computationally most expensive step in the construction of an
approximate transfer operator is the numerical integration of many short
term trajectories. In this paper, we propose to directly work with the
infinitesimal generator instead of the operator, completely avoiding
trajectory integration. We propose two different discretization schemes;
a cell based discretization and a spectral collocation approach.
Convergence can be shown in certain circumstances. We demonstrate
numerically that our approach is much more efficient than the operator
approach, sometimes by several orders of magnitude.

\item[2012-09-13 Predrag] \emph{What does `kernel' mean in `integral kernel'?}
The English usage is a translation of the German `kern', meaning kernel,
core, nucleus, \ie, something central or essential. There are two usages
in mathematics, kernels of \emph{transforms}, and kernels of
\emph{mappings}. In integral equations and Fourier analysis the term was
first used by Fredholm (1903) and Hilbert (1904), referring to an
integrable generalization $K(x,y)$ of a matrix $M_{jk}$. The use in
algebra is unrelated, with `kernel' of a homomorphism being the inverse
image of the zero element, a synonym for `null-space' of a linear
transformation between vector spaces.

That is what POT does. Let $\obser = \obser(\ssp)$ be a function that
associates to each fluid state $\ssp$ a property such as the
dissipation rate, and let \({\Obser_p}/{\period{p}}\)
% \APW{This is pretty confusing unless $A_p$ is clearly defined.}
be its time
average evaluated on a time-periodic solution $p$ of period
$\period{p}$. In describing the statistics of turbulence, one is
interested in the average of the property $\obser(\ssp)$ over all
fluid states. In POT this average is given by
% \APW{maybe convert to words only and reference
% chaosbook more precisely?}
the \emph{exact
\cycForm} (for details, see \wwwcb{}): \(\expct{\obser} =
\sum_\pseudos\Obser_{\pseudos}t_\pseudos
/\sum_\pseudos\period{\pseudos}t_\pseudos\,,\) where the sums are
over all sets of distinct prime \po s, or `pseudo-cycles'
$\pseudos = \{ p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k \}$.
\(t_\pseudos  = (-1)^{k+1} /\ExpaEig_\pseudos\)
is the weight of the pseudo-cycle $\pseudos$, where
\(\ExpaEig_{\pseudos} =
\ExpaEig_{p_1}\ExpaEig_{p_2} \cdots \ExpaEig_{p_{k}}\), and
\(\ExpaEig_{p} = \left|\prod_e \ExpaEig_{p,e}\right|\)
is the product
of the expanding eigenvalues of the \jacobianM\ of \po\ $p$.
\(
\period{\pseudos}=\period{p_1}+ \ldots + \period{p_{k}}
\) is the pseudo-cycle period, and
\(
\Obser_\pseudos = \Obser_{p_1}+ \ldots + \Obser_{p_{k}}
\) is the pseudo-cycle  observable.
The geometrical meaning of a pseudo-cycle is that it is a sequence of
shorter \po s that shadow a longer \po\ along segments $p_1$,
$p_2, \dots$, $p_k$, with the relative minus signs ensuring shadowing
cancelations. For hyperbolic flows, $\ExpaEig_p$ grow exponentially
with period $\period{p}$, so these infinite sums are exponentially
convergent, provided the terms are ordered by the decreasing
pseudo-cycle weights $t_\pseudos$. In applications they are truncated
by including only terms such that
\(\ExpaEig_{\pseudos}\leq\stabCutoff\,.\)

How does POT do compared with DNS long-time averaging? In
\cite{ChaKer12} not all that well. The single, least unstable of all
solutions, \recFlow\ $R19$, the only one with only two unstable
directions, lumps up the averages. \cite{ChaKer12} then do the
crudest test, and compare DNS with the agnostic `protocol 3', which
democratically gives equal weight to all solutions, the good, the
bad and the kitchen sink, in the spirit of The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change Synthesis Report, which `synthesizes and
integrates' all predictions received, from dead wrong to not so
crazy, as a simple average. The agnostic average works somewhat
better than POT. Then, for no good reason at all, they exhume from
the vastly uneven `chaos' literature (should erroneous papers be
cited?) the `escape-time weighting'. These formulas are wrong. So
they work just as well as the equally wrong simple know-nothing
average.''

``
Finally, a plea for a modicum of mathematical realism: we do not know
whether the 2\dmn\ H\'enon attractor is a strange attractor (and not
a transient), so why should we expect that someone prove that
turbulence is sustained, and not a transient that will decay by the

into the discussion should both free us from such preoccupations, and
tell us how many \recFlow s are enough.

A particle moving deterministically in a chaotic spatially extended
environment can exhibit normal diffusion, with its mean square
displacement growing proportional to the time. Here we consider the
dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the size and the position of
dynamical channels (`holes') linking spatial regions. The system
properties can be obtained analytically via a Taylor-Green-Kubo formula
in terms of a functional recursion relation, leading to a diffusion
coefficient varying with the hole positions and non-monotonically on
their size. We derive analytic formulas for small holes in terms of
periodic orbits covered by the holes. The asymptotic regimes that we
observe show deviations from a simple random walk approximation, a
phenomenon that should be ubiquitous in dynamical systems and might be
observed experimentally. The escape rate of the corresponding open system
is also calculated. The resulting parameter dependencies are compared
with the ones for the diffusion coefficient and explained in terms of
periodic orbits.

\item[2011-08-28 Chao]
In the second paragraph of page 516, we obtain two equilibrium points and
each of them has totally three dimensional manifolds and three Floquet
multipliers. Since KS equation is one-dimensional, where are the two
other dimensions from? I saw that you put the two equilibrium points in
three-dimensional space and extend the coordinate to be $c_+ =
(\sqrt{c},0,0),c_- = (-\sqrt{c},0,0)$, but this does not bring in the
dependence on the other two dimensions, right?

\item[2011-09-10 PC]
\KSe\ is a PDE in one or two spatial dimensions, so it corresponds to an
\emph{infinity} of ODEs. \Eqv\ condition for 1 spatial dimension KS sets
the left-hand of the equation to zero, so the right hand side (in the 1
spatial dimension case \emph{only}) becomes a 4th order ODE in $d/dx$.
One integral you can do, so the system becomes a 3rd order ODE +
integration constant, or 3 first order ODEs. The best papers on this are

\item[2011-08-28 Chao]
Up to this point I am confused with another point that in Chapter 4, when
defining Floquet multipliers and stable/unstable manifold, we
introduced Jacobian matrix of continuous time-dependent map $f(x,t)$. We
expand the map f to first order and get Jacobian matrix as the
coefficient matrix. But here in KS system, we do not know the explicit
form of $f(x,t)$, which should be the solution. Then how do we deduce the
Jacobian matrix without knowing the map explicitly?

\item[2011-09-10 PC] You almost never have an explicit formula for the
\JacobianM, it is always a numerically computed linearized map. What you
do have is an explicit formula for the {\stabmat} ${\Mvar}$, in the case
of KS you have written it out in \refeq{KSstabMat2}.

\item[2013-03-27 PC] Had to give up on
this text in my focusPOTty article. Maybe can use it in
ChaosBook?:

Turbulent flows never settle down, yet we can recognize a cloud by
its transitory shapes. What are these fleeting shadows? The discovery
of unstable steady and travelling solutions of Navier-Stokes
equations, together with glimpses of them in experiments
\citep{science04}, caries a promise of obtaining a description of
turbulent flow in terms of the dynamics of a handful of exact
solutions. Intriguing as they are, these solutions are shapes that do
not change in time, but turbulence does. To capture it, one needs
dynamics. \cite{MS66} had proposed that time-periodic solutions
should do the job.
Sadly, searching for \po s will never bring as
much delight as a week on C\^{o}te d'Azur, or publishing yet another
log-log plot in {\em Phys. Rev. Letters}. Finding an unstable
periodic solution of a 3{\dmn} chaotic ODE is much like learning how
to catch a boomerang while blindfolded. It is still harder to hit the
starting point in 4~dimensions, and
The possibility that one could
adjust myriad of initial velocity fields of a 3$D$ turbulent fluid
state in such a way that the flow would \emph{exactly} recur after a
finite time had always seemed utterly out of reach.

That is, until the Christmas of 2000, when \cite{KawKida01} announced
that they have found an ``unstable periodic solution of the
Navier-Stokes equation.'' In 8,448\dmn\ discretization of the \pCf! A
solution that was not only periodic in time, but lay smack in the
turbulent sea and predicted turbulent averages surprisingly well.
Once the first transistor is built, the impossible becomes possible,
and the heroic feat that it was, it was eventually followed by
\cite{Visw07b}, \cite{CviGib10}, \cite{KreEck12}, and \cite{ACHKW11},
who together determined some hundred such solutions for 3$D$ flows.
Today an undergraduate can download

\item[2011-12-01 Jim Yorke to PC] The Kaplan Yorke Dimension is a formula
involving Lyapunov exponents. So we called the KY Dimension. No -- just
joking. We called it the Lyapunov Dimension. Logical?

\item[2011-12-01 PC to Jim Yorke] \emph{Who is the 2000th person who
invoked Lyapunov's name in vain?} Poor Lyapunov. He is a surname, not
concept, but his name gets attached to zillion things he had nothing to
do with.

There is something called ``Lyapunov equation'' which actually is in his
thesis, at least for the strictly contracting fixed point case.

Then there things like ``Lyapunov Covariant Vectors'' that he has nothing
to do with in any imaginable way which yield a ``physical dimension'' of
attractors of PDEs such as Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Landau-Ginzburg. That
DOES NOT count Lyapunov exponents, it counts non-hyperbolically connected
``Covariant Vectors'', and seems to give a number roughly twice the KY
dimension.

So I'll stick to calling the KY dimension  ``Kaplan Yorke dimension'', and
leave poor Belorussian aristocrat out of this.

\emph{Who is the 2nd person who invented General Relativity?}

Dear Jim, I know you do not find renormalization in period doubling
important, but if you do mention it:


Feigenbaum discovered and fully formulated period-doubling universality
in 1975, you can click on the link to Feigenbaum's first report from 1976
\HREF{http://www.cns.gatech.edu/~predrag/papers/preprints.html\#Trans2chaos}{here}.
In 1981 Lanford satisfied himself that the iterative method we used and
knew was contracting was indeed contracting. He refers only to the
Feigenbaum paper.
\HREF{http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/21/74/80/PDF/ajp-jphyscol197839C513.pdf}
{Coullet and Tresser} refer to the Feigenbaum paper. It's there something
essential that is missing in the 1976 formulation?

I'm very fond of all three of them - all creative and crazy as bats. I
just do not get their names on the equation that was widely known and
publicized well before 1978?

As far as I can tell, Lyubich renamed the equations. I asked him why? He
wrote:

``In 90s, I talked to both Feigenbaum and Tresser, and my conclusion was
that Coullet-Tresser discovered the phenomenon independently, though
slightly later. Also, they seemed to recognize better importance of the
dynamical universality (while Feigenbaum focused more on  the parameter
phenomenon.) I felt that Coullet-Tresser did  not receive a proper credit
for their insights, so I attached all three names to the phenomenon.''

OK, that's nice. Feigenbaum and I do not recognize ``importance of the
dynamical universality'', whatever that might mean. While at it, why not
give credit to the guy who wrote the fixed point equation first? What am
I, dog meat? Never mind...

People reinvent stuff all the time. Myrheim and I generalized period
doubling to
\HREF{http://www.cns.gatech.edu/~predrag/papers/preprints.html\#ComplexRenorm}
{infinity of renomalizations} in the complex plane, but once I was told
that Golberg, Sinai and Khanin did it first (for period tripling), I
refer to them even though we discovered it without knowing that they did
it, both in 1983.

I agree with you - why attach any names to equations? Anyway, it's just
the way things are. Pretty soon the attribution problems will sort
themselves out by themselves - heart attacks and homicidal Atlanta
drivers will take care of that. Cheers \& red socks forever
