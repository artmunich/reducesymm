I have added this chapter to collect your ChaosBook.org edits /
comments. If you svn co dasbuch, you have the dasbuch/book/chapter/*.tex
source code and can clip and paste formulas to here. I never refer to a
chapter by it's current number, as chapter numbers change from edition to
edition - latter on (years hence) trying to figure out what ``Chapter
17'' is can be quite confusing. Internally, each chapter is kept track
off by its file name, for example, in this blog ``continuous'' refers to
\refchap{c-continuous} {\em Relativity for cyclists}.

Haddad\rf{HaCh08} says:                     \toCB

A dynamical system consists of three elements -- namely, a setting (called
the state space) in which the dynamical behavior takes place, such as a
torus, topological space, manifold, or locally compact metric space; a
mathematical rule or dynamic which specifies the evolution of the system
over time; and an initial condition or state from which the system starts
at some initial time.

\begin{description}

\item[2011-04-05 CS] A question about the last sentence in the first
paragraph of Section 5.4  discussed in the group study last week: Why
does the neighborhood size scale as $1/|\Lambda_{p}|$? Wouldn't it scale
as $|\Lambda_{p}|$?

\item[2011-04-06 PC] Mhm, clearly not written clearly enough, but perhaps
the most important property of an unstable flow that one has to
understand. The product of expanding multipliers $|\Lambda_{p}|$ blows up
exponentially with time, but the \emph{neighborhood shrinks}
exponentially with time, Detroit-like. Does looking at Figure 5.1 help?
Does reading Sect. 1.5.1 help? If you understand it, can you rewrite

                                                    \toCB
``
Nearby points aligned along the stable (contracting) directions  remain
in the neighborhood of the trajectory $\ssp(t)= \flow{t}{\xInit}$; the
ones to keep an eye on are the points which leave the neighborhood along
the unstable directions because all nonlinear phenomena comes from these
directions. The sub-volume $ |\pS_{\xInit}| = \prod_i^e\Delta \ssp_i$ of
the set of points which get no further away from $\flow{t}{\xInit}$ than
$L$, the typical size of the system, is fixed by the condition that
$\Delta \ssp_i \ExpaEig_i = O(L)$ in each expanding direction $i$. Hence
the neighborhood size scales as $|\pS_{\xInit}| \propto
O(L^{d_e})/|\ExpaEig_p| \propto 1/|\ExpaEig_p| $ where $\ExpaEig_p$ is
the product of expanding Floquet multipliers
(5.7) %\refeq{expVol}
only; contracting ones play a secondary role.
''

so it makes sense to you. If you and Adam do not understand it, then
bring it up for discussion in the study group.

\item[2011-04-11 CS]
rewrote Paragraph 1 of Section 5.4 as follows:

\CSedit{
Nearby points aligned along the stable (contracting) directions  remain
in the neighborhood of the trajectory $\ssp(t)= \flow{t}{\xInit}$; the
ones to keep an eye on are the points which leave the neighborhood along
the unstable directions because almost all nonlinear and chaotic
phenomena comes from these directions. The sub-volume $ |\pS_{\xInit}| =
\prod_i^e\Delta \ssp_i$ of the set of points which get no further away
from $\flow{t}{\xInit}$ than $L$, the typical size of the system, is
fixed by the condition that $\Delta \ssp_i \ExpaEig_i = O(L)$ in each
expanding direction $i$. Hence the neighborhood size scales as
$|\pS_{\xInit}| \propto O(L^{d_e})/|\ExpaEig_p| \propto 1/|\ExpaEig_p| $
where $\ExpaEig_p$ is the product of expanding Floquet multipliers
(5.7) %\refeq{expVol}
only(see section 1.5.1 and figure 1.9 for example);
contracting ones play a secondary role}

\item[2011-04-12 PC] Thanks, I have now rewritten the introduction to the
Chapter as well as the section 5.4 is the spirit you suggest, emphasizing
the key role the concept of 'neighborhood' will play.

\begin{description}

\item[2011-04-11 CS]
Finished this Chapter. Generally able to understand it but feel like
there's whole lot more content underneath that as in the KS
transformation for example. There should be a lot tricks and methods to
construct such regularization. And I wonder what kind of singularity
could be regularized. But I guess that this is not an easy question and
should not be the emphasis to my project.


\item[2011-04-11 CS]
A trivial error: eq.~(6.13) should be ``$\sqrt{x}dx = 2dt$'',
rather than ``$\sqrt{x}dx = \sqrt{2}dt$''.

\item[2011-04-12 PC]
No error is 'trivial.' Thanks.

%%-----   Newton
\section{Chapter: Hamiltonian dynamics}
\label{c-newton}\noindent dasbuch/book/chapter/newton.tex
\begin{description}

\item[2012-01-02 CS to PC]
I am wondering how to choose phase space
coordinates? Do phase/state space coordinates have any requirement and
whether conservation of space volume is such a requirement? What's the
meaning of conservation of phase space requirement? In my understanding
in Hamiltonian flows, conservation of phase space volume means
conservation of energy, am I right?

\item[[2012-01-02 PC]
Now, it is more subtle than that; time dependent flow can be symplectic,
but energy is not conserved; I think Percival and D.
Richards\rf{PerRich82N} (I have it in the
\HREF{http://www.cns.gatech.edu/CNS-only/LibraryCat2.htm} {CNS library})
discuss that well. Symplectic invariance is \emph{much stronger}
requirement than either either energy conservation or phase-space volume
conservation, see \HREF{http://chaosbook.org/chapters/newton.pdf}
{Section 7.4 Poincar\'e invariants} and
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/chapters/appendStability.pdf} {Appendix D.4
Stability of Hamiltonian flows}: symplectic transformations preserve area
for each $(q,p)$ dual coordinate  pair.

\begin{description}

\item[2011-03-30  CS to PC]
I have a question from the paragraph
following the definition of free action: The splitting of a group
\emph{G} into a stabilizer \emph{$G_{p}$} and \emph{m-1} coset
\emph{$cG_{p}$} relates to an orbit \emph{$M_{p}$} to \emph{m-1} other
distinct orbits \emph{$cM_{p}$}. All of them have equivalent stabilizers,
or more precisely, the points on the same group orbit have
\emph{conjugate stabilizers}: \emph{$G_{cp} = cG_{p}c^{-1}$}. For the
last sentence, does it mean that if \emph{$G_{p}$}  is a stabilizer of
\emph{$M_{p}$}, then \emph{$cG_{p}c^{-1}$} is a stabilizer of
\emph{$cM_{p}$}?

\item[2011-03-31 PC] Yes, you are right. I have now incorporated ``if
\emph{$G_{p}$}  is a stabilizer of \emph{$M_{p}$}, then
\emph{$cG_{p}c^{-1}$} is a stabilizer of \emph{$cM_{p}$}'' into
discrete.tex, thanks.

I intend to excise the dreaded word `stabilizer' from the text, just have
forgotten to do it
\HREF{http://www.flickr.com/photos/birdtracks/4259634492/in/set-72157606259014811/}
{[click]} here. Suggestion - print out the chapter, replace by hand word
`stabilizer' everywhere by 'symmetry' and let's sit together and see
whether the chapter is  easier to read.

\item[2011-04-19 CS]
BTW, any recommendation for a hands on book for Lie group and Lie
algebra? I think I need a deeper knowledge about this.

\item[2011-04-20 PC] I suggested in the siminos/blog/
that you check out a book from the library that Meiss recommends. Do it, see
whether it eases the pain. You can also get
Gilmore and Letellier\rf{GL-Gil07b}
{\em The Symmetry of Chaos} out of the CNS library. It only does the
invariant polynomial reduction (Siminos and I believe that is useless in
higher dimensions), but it is pretty good on discrete symmetries.

 By Jin-Quan Chen, Jialun Ping (looks nice, get it):

``A sum of the elements belonging to a class is called class operator.
Class operators need not be unitary.They commute with every element of

They are closed under multiplication. They form a class algebra.''

``
For this, and the preceding chapter only, we also relax the nomenclature

   `trajectory' is here understood in the dynamical sense,

I am stuck at trying to understand eq.~(10.16):
\[
\oint\frac{d\theta}{2\pi}(\textbf{T}u(\theta))^{\emph{T}}\textbf{T}u(2\pi-\theta)
 = \sum\limits_{m=0}^{\infty}m^{2}(u_{1}^{(m)2}+u_{2}^{(m)2})
\]
First, why would there be a integral on left hand side? Second, why the
integrand is $(\textbf{T}u(\theta))^{\emph{T}}\textbf{T}u(2\pi-\theta)$?
Shouldn't it be $(\textbf{T}u(\theta))^{\emph{T}}\textbf{T}u(\theta)$
according to eq. (10.11)?

\item[2011-04-20 PC] $u(\theta)$ is a function on the interval $[0,2\pi]$,
hence integral on the left side (LHS). Compact support, hence the infinite sum
on the RHS. If I remember right (check notes or the textbook from
our Math Methods course) for Fourier transforms, a convolution on the
left hand side gives me a product on the right hand side. If I'm wrong,
let me know so I fix this; as you say, does not look like $L^2$ norm...

About Example 12.3 H\'enon repeller complete horseshoe:
First, in figure 12.4, why after one step's evolution, point B occupies
point D's original spot and also point C and point D are in the stable
manifold? I do not think this is just a coincidence but still haven't
figure out the reason.

\item[2011-07-22 CS] I read the Smale Horseshoe part in Kai's thesis. Now
I understand why the binary sequence has to be assigned this way. Only in
this way can the symbol represent the actual map. It's hard to describe
it but this picture found from wiki helped me a lot.

we need to know both the future and the past.'' With the help of this

I had noticed Demidov's website before - you are right, these simulations
are very instructive, I have now added a remark about them to ChaosBook.
He uses a different definition for parameters $a$ and $b$ from H\'enon,
but unfortunately uses the same letters. His definition is natural if one
is interested in Julia sets, but unfortunately not the one H\'enon used,
and I always try to follow the foundational papers, rather than confusing
everybody with sly parameter redefinitions.

Demidov's parametrization\rf{DemChaos} of the H\'enon map is:
\bea

        \continue
    y_{n+1}' &=& x_n'

Dividing through by $a'$ we get
\(
\frac{x_{n+1}'}{a'} = 1 + a'\left(\frac{x_n'}{a'}\right)^2 + b'\frac{y_n'}{a'}

so the two parametrizations are related by:

You need the transformation between two definitions, if you are
going to use Demidov's simulations to test your ideas, and it helps greatly
if the transformation formula is the correct one. If
I am right, if you chose
\(
a'=-6

b'= -1

In \emph{Estimating long term behavior of flows without trajectory
integration: the infinitesimal generator approach}, \arXiv{1101.4166}
Gary Froyland, Oliver Junge and P\'eter Koltai write:
``
The long-term distributions of trajectories of a flow are described by
invariant densities, i.e. fixed points of an associated transfer
operator. In addition, global slowly mixing structures, such as
almost-invariant sets, which partition phase space into regions that are
almost dynamically disconnected, can also be identified by certain
eigenfunctions of this operator. Indeed, these structures are often hard
to obtain by brute-force trajectory-based analyses. In a wide variety of
applications, transfer operators have proven to be very efficient tools
for an analysis of the global behavior of a dynamical system.
The computationally most expensive step in the construction of an
approximate transfer operator is the numerical integration of many short
term trajectories. In this paper, we propose to directly work with the
infinitesimal generator instead of the operator, completely avoiding
trajectory integration. We propose two different discretization schemes;
a cell based discretization and a spectral collocation approach.
Convergence can be shown in certain circumstances. We demonstrate
numerically that our approach is much more efficient than the operator
approach, sometimes by several orders of magnitude.

Creagh\rf{Creagh93} refers to \rpo s as ``pseudoperiodic'' orbits.
\refRef{BisPal98}  refers to \rpo s as ``reduced periodic'' orbits, and
to the corresponding orbits in the full {\statesp} as ``quasiperiodic.''
\PC{use word quasiperiodic}
Creagh remarks at the very end of his paper to his formula (6.4) as the
``pleasing result that the quantally reduced spectrum is determined by
the classically reduced periodic orbits in the usual way.'' \PC{but no
character weight in (6.4)?}

Guillemin and Uribe\rf{GuiUri87,GuiUri89,GuiUri90} discuss a trace formula in
symmetry-reduced space. For \refref{GuiUri90}

Muratore-Ginanneschi\rf{Murat03} gives an elegant
discussion of ``zero-modes'' in the path integral formulation, but does
not go to irreps either.

Strutinskii and  Magner\rf{StrMag76} give a
Balian Bloch trace formula for systems with cont symmetries,
specific nuclear theory examples" ``
The quasiclassical approximation for the density of single-particle
levels based on {Feynman} path integrals is extended to the case of
degenerate classical motion. It is shown that the appreciable
fluctuations (gross shells) in the density of the single-particle levels
correspond to quasiclassical quantization of the motion in
multidimensional periodic orbits. Formal estimates are obtained for the
scale and period of the oscillations of the single-particle level
density, the level density of an excited nucleus, and the shell
corrections to the binding energies and deformation energies of nuclei.
The connection between the classical theory and the method of numerical
averaging is discussed.

\begin{description}
\item[2011-12-19 PC] An interesting paper, worth study:
Georgie Knight, Orestis Georgiou, Carl Dettmann, and Rainer Klages say in
\emph{Where to place a hole to achieve a maximal diffusion coefficient},
 \arXiv{1112.3922}: ``
A particle moving deterministically in a chaotic spatially extended
environment can exhibit normal diffusion, with its mean square
displacement growing proportional to the time. Here we consider the
dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the size and the position of
dynamical channels (`holes') linking spatial regions. The system
properties can be obtained analytically via a Taylor-Green-Kubo formula
in terms of a functional recursion relation, leading to a diffusion
coefficient varying with the hole positions and non-monotonically on
their size. We derive analytic formulas for small holes in terms of
periodic orbits covered by the holes. The asymptotic regimes that we
observe show deviations from a simple random walk approximation, a
phenomenon that should be ubiquitous in dynamical systems and might be
observed experimentally. The escape rate of the corresponding open system
is also calculated. The resulting parameter dependencies are compared
with the ones for the diffusion coefficient and explained in terms of
periodic orbits.

explains the relation between $L$ and the hyperviscosity
$\nu$, and it should be the fastest introduction to \KSe.

\item[2011-08-28 Chao]

In the second paragraph of section 26.1.1, it is said ``KS equation is
Galilean invariant: if $u(x,t)$ is a solution, then $v+u(x+2vt,t)$ with
$v$ an arbitrary constant velocity is also a solution.'' So I substitute
$v+u(x+2vt,t)$ into KS equation given by 26.2, but it seems that the new
equation does not keep the original form with additional term $3vu_x$.
Would you please show me explicitly how this works?

\item[2011-08-30 Predrag] thanks for catching this typo, it should be
$v+u(x-vt,t)$. Corrected now.

\item[2011-08-28 Chao]
I do not understand the dimensional analysis in the following
paragraph. Why does time has the dimension of square of length? Why does
viscosity has the same dimension with time? Plus, where does
``viscosity'' show up in the original KS equation 26.2?

\item[2011-08-30 Predrag] thanks for catching this typo (I had not
entered the hyper-viscosity parameter $\nu$ in the defining equation).

\item[2011-08-28 Chao]
In the second paragraph of page 516, we obtain two equilibrium points and
each of them has totally three dimensional manifolds and three Floquet
multipliers. Since KS equation is one-dimensional, where are the two
other dimensions from? I saw that you put the two equilibrium points in
three-dimensional space and extend the coordinate to be $c_+ =
(\sqrt{c},0,0),c_- = (-\sqrt{c},0,0)$, but this does not bring in the
dependence on the other two dimensions, right?

\KSe\ is a PDE in one or two spatial dimensions, so it corresponds to an
\emph{infinity} of ODEs. \Eqv\ condition for 1 spatial dimension KS sets
the left-hand of the equation to zero, so the right hand side (in the 1
spatial dimension case \emph{only}) becomes a 4th order ODE in $d/dx$.
One integral you can do, so the system becomes a 3rd order ODE +
integration constant, or 3 first order ODEs. The best papers on this are

\item[2011-08-28 Chao]
Up to this point I am confused with another point that in Chapter 4, when
defining Floquet multipliers and stable/unstable manifold, we
introduced Jacobian matrix of continuous time-dependent map $f(x,t)$. We
expand the map f to first order and get Jacobian matrix as the
coefficient matrix. But here in KS system, we do not know the explicit
form of $f(x,t)$, which should be the solution. Then how do we deduce the
Jacobian matrix without knowing the map explicitly?

\item[2011-09-10 PC] You almost never have an explicit formula for the
\JacobianM, it is always a numerically computed linearized map. What you
do have is an explicit formula for the {\stabmat} ${\Mvar}$, in the case
of KS you have written it out in \refeq{KSstabMat2}.

%-----   Dimension of turbulence

\item[2011-12-01 PC to Jim Yorke]
I agree with you - why attach any names to equations?  I like the thing
referred to as ``Kaplan-Yorke dimension''. Do you have a more descriptive
name for it?

\item[2011-12-01 Jim Yorke to PC] The Kaplan Yorke Dimension is a formula
involving Lyapunov exponents. So we called the KY Dimension. No -- just
joking. We called it the Lyapunov Dimension. Logical?

\item[2011-12-01 PC to Jim Yorke] \emph{Who is the 2000th person who
invoked Lyapunov's name in vain?} Poor Lyapunov. He is a surname, not
concept, but his name gets attached to zillion things he had nothing to
do with.

There is something called ``Lyapunov equation'' which actually is in his
thesis, at least for the strictly contracting fixed point case.

Then there things like ``Lyapunov Covariant Vectors'' that he has nothing
to do with in any imaginable way which yield a ``physical dimension'' of
attractors of PDEs such as Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Landau-Ginzburg. That
DOES NOT count Lyapunov exponents, it counts non-hyperbolically connected
``Covariant Vectors'', and seems to give a number roughly twice the KY
dimension.

So I'll stick to calling the KY dimension  ``Kaplan Yorke dimension'', and
leave poor Belorussian aristocrat out of this.

\emph{Who is the 2nd person who invented General Relativity?}
(Answer: Who remembers?)

Dear Jim, I know you do not find renormalization in period doubling
important, but if you do mention it:


Feigenbaum discovered and fully formulated period-doubling universality
in 1975, you can click on the link to Feigenbaum's first report from 1976
\HREF{http://www.cns.gatech.edu/~predrag/papers/preprints.html\#Trans2chaos}{here}.
In 1981 Lanford satisfied himself that the iterative method we used and
knew was contracting was indeed contracting. He refers only to the
Feigenbaum paper.
\HREF{http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/21/74/80/PDF/ajp-jphyscol197839C513.pdf}
{Coullet and Tresser} refer to the Feigenbaum paper. It's there something
essential that is missing in the 1976 formulation?

I'm very fond of all three of them - all creative and crazy as bats. I
just do not get their names on the equation that was widely known and
publicized well before 1978?

As far as I can tell, Lyubich renamed the equations. I asked him why? He
wrote:

``In 90s, I talked to both Feigenbaum and Tresser, and my conclusion was
that Coullet-Tresser discovered the phenomenon independently, though
slightly later. Also, they seemed to recognize better importance of the
dynamical universality (while Feigenbaum focused more on  the parameter
phenomenon.) I felt that Coullet-Tresser did  not receive a proper credit
for their insights, so I attached all three names to the phenomenon.''

OK, that's nice. Feigenbaum and I do not recognize ``importance of the
dynamical universality'', whatever that might mean. While at it, why not
give credit to the guy who wrote the fixed point equation first? What am
I, dog meat? Never mind...

People reinvent stuff all the time. Myrheim and I generalized period
doubling to
\HREF{http://www.cns.gatech.edu/~predrag/papers/preprints.html\#ComplexRenorm}
{infinity of renomalizations} in the complex plane, but once I was told
that Golberg, Sinai and Khanin did it first (for period tripling), I
refer to them even though we discovered it without knowing that they did
it, both in 1983.

I agree with you - why attach any names to equations? Anyway, it's just
the way things are. Pretty soon the attribution problems will sort
themselves out by themselves - heart attacks and homicidal Atlanta
drivers will take care of that. Cheers \& red socks forever

\item[2011-12-01 Jim Yorke to PC] Thank you very much for the detailed
and enlightening discussion.

\item[2012-07-22 PC]
Vergini\rf{Vergini12} writes in {\em Semiclassical approach to long time
propagation in quantum chaos: predicting scars}:

``
We present two powerful semiclassical formulas for quantum systems with
classically chaotic dynamics, one of them being the Fourier transform of
the other. The first formula evaluates the autocorrelation function of a
state constructed in the neighborhood of a short periodic orbit, where
the propagation for times greater than the Ehrenfest time is computed
through the contribution of homoclinic orbits. The second formula
evaluates the square of the overlap of the proposed state with the
eigenstates of the system, providing valuable information about the
scarring phenomenon.
