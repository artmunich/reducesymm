I have added this chapter to collect your ChaosBook.org edits /
comments. If you svn co dasbuch, you have the dasbuch/book/chapter/*.tex
source code and can clip and paste formulas to here. I never refer to a
chapter by its current number, as chapter numbers change from edition to
edition - latter on (years hence) trying to figure out what ``Chapter
17'' is can be quite confusing. Internally, each chapter is kept track
off by its file name, for example, in this blog ``continuous'' refers to
\refchap{c-continuous} {\em Relativity for cyclists}.

Now, I'm just curious - here is blah blah from my blog:

% \item[2012-08-12 PC]
Georgiou, Dettmann and Altmann\rf{GeDeAl12}
\emph{Faster than expected escape for a class of fully chaotic maps},
\arXiv{1207.7000}, have a potentially interesting trace formula. Am I
minced meat? Remind them to cite ChaosBook.org. Funny thing is, Dettmann
is a contributor to it. Is he ashamed of his youthful digressions?

%\item[2012-10-10 Predrag]
For a theorist like me, Avlund et al.\rf{AEOGS10} experimental / theoretical
paper
\emph{Observation of periodic orbits on curved two-dimensional geometries}
is a remarkable achievement. One author is my former PhD student, three
others are my collaborators. The first sentence of the paper says
``semiclassics, in particular, periodic orbit theory, provides a powerful
connection to the dynamics of the analogous classical system [1-4].'' Of
the four textbooks cited, one is on periodic orbit theory. What is this
fear of ChaosBook.org? Am I minced meat? Do I have advanced halitosis? I
understand that the co-authors of the ChaosBook.org have not read it, but
they have not read the other four books that they cite either. Can
somebody explain to me where ChaosBook.org falls short?

\item[2012-10-12 Mark Oxborrow] re. ``Predrag is from pleistocene:''
Why? I've read your ``why a web book'' which make many valid and
important points. But here is me thinking off the top of my head.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
People are just plain conservative, stuck in their ways, and slow to
catch on.  To misquote Planck: ``A new form of publishing does not
triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but
rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows
up that is familiar with it.''
    \item
When writing a traditionally published paper, the inevitably out-of-date
``style guide'' handed out by the relevant publisher fails to instruct on
how, exactly, a reference to a web-based resource should be formatted.
There are quite a few permutations and combinations to consider. ``PRL
78, 567 (2007)'' is in contrast a canonical no-brainer but doing the same
for a web resource takes more effort and one is always worried that some
pedant of a copy editor at the journal will slow one's publication down
by a month by nit-picking at one's non-standard formatting of web book
references.
    \item
With respect to the last point made in ``why a web book'', authors like
citing things that are set in stone. It's about control and security. An
authors feels uneasy about citing an evolving book because one does not
quite know what it will look like when the reader of one's paper chases
down the reference to said book four-and-a-half years' time.  The cited
web-resource may have become hacked and taken over by the Moonies in the
interim.  Ironically, authors feel that citing traditional
published-on-paper references Is way of future proofing their work.
\end{enumerate}
But all in all. I think it's just plain boring conservatism. Attitudes
and behaviours will change in time. Slowly. When Elsevier, Taylor and
Francis, or even the IOP get taken over by the Moonies, authors will
realize that paper was not so permanent after all.

%%-----   Flows

\begin{description}

\item[2012-01-02 PC]
Haddad\rf{HaCh08} says:                     \toCB

A dynamical system consists of three elements -- namely, a setting (called
the state space) in which the dynamical behavior takes place, such as a
torus, topological space, manifold, or locally compact metric space; a
mathematical rule or dynamic which specifies the evolution of the system
over time; and an initial condition or state from which the system starts
at some initial time.

\item[2013-02-26 PC]                \toCB
Proposal: First, explain difference between Floquet multipliers and
stretching rates for an explicit 3\dmn example. Second, show the
relation to Lyapunov exponents by looking at the infinite repeat of a
cycle. Prove that the leading Floquet exponent goes into the leading
Lyapunov exponent. Is it true for the rest of the spectrum?

%%-----   Cycle stability
\section{Chapter: Cycle stability}
\label{c-invariants}\noindent dasbuch/book/chapter/invariants.tex
\begin{description}

\item[2011-04-05 CS] A question about the last sentence in the first
paragraph of Section 5.4  discussed in the group study last week: Why
does the neighborhood size scale as $1/|\Lambda_{p}|$? Wouldn't it scale
as $|\Lambda_{p}|$?

\item[2011-04-06 PC] Mhm, clearly not written clearly enough, but perhaps
the most important property of an unstable flow that one has to
understand. The product of expanding multipliers $|\Lambda_{p}|$ blows up
exponentially with time, but the \emph{neighborhood shrinks}
exponentially with time, Detroit-like. Does looking at Figure 5.1 help?
Does reading Sect. 1.5.1 help? If you understand it, can you rewrite

                                                    \toCB
``
Nearby points aligned along the stable (contracting) directions  remain
in the neighborhood of the trajectory $\ssp(t)= \flow{t}{\xInit}$; the
ones to keep an eye on are the points which leave the neighborhood along
the unstable directions because all nonlinear phenomena comes from these
directions. The sub-volume $ |\pS_{\xInit}| = \prod_i^e\Delta \ssp_i$ of
the set of points which get no further away from $\flow{t}{\xInit}$ than
$L$, the typical size of the system, is fixed by the condition that
$\Delta \ssp_i \ExpaEig_i = O(L)$ in each expanding direction $i$. Hence
the neighborhood size scales as $|\pS_{\xInit}| \propto
O(L^{d_e})/|\ExpaEig_p| \propto 1/|\ExpaEig_p| $ where $\ExpaEig_p$ is
the product of expanding Floquet multipliers
(5.7) %\refeq{expVol}
only; contracting ones play a secondary role.
''

so it makes sense to you. If you and Adam do not understand it, then
bring it up for discussion in the study group.

\item[2011-04-11 CS]
rewrote Paragraph 1 of Section 5.4 as follows:

\CSedit{
Nearby points aligned along the stable (contracting) directions  remain
in the neighborhood of the trajectory $\ssp(t)= \flow{t}{\xInit}$; the
ones to keep an eye on are the points which leave the neighborhood along
the unstable directions because almost all nonlinear and chaotic
phenomena comes from these directions. The sub-volume $ |\pS_{\xInit}| =
\prod_i^e\Delta \ssp_i$ of the set of points which get no further away
from $\flow{t}{\xInit}$ than $L$, the typical size of the system, is
fixed by the condition that $\Delta \ssp_i \ExpaEig_i = O(L)$ in each
expanding direction $i$. Hence the neighborhood size scales as
$|\pS_{\xInit}| \propto O(L^{d_e})/|\ExpaEig_p| \propto 1/|\ExpaEig_p| $
where $\ExpaEig_p$ is the product of expanding Floquet multipliers
(5.7) %\refeq{expVol}
only(see section 1.5.1 and figure 1.9 for example);
contracting ones play a secondary role}

\item[2011-04-12 PC] Thanks, I have now rewritten the introduction to the
Chapter as well as the section 5.4 is the spirit you suggest, emphasizing
the key role the concept of 'neighborhood' will play.

%%-----   Smooth conjugacies
\section{Chapter: Go straight}
\label{c-conjug}\noindent dasbuch/book/chapter/conjug.tex
\begin{description}

\item[2011-04-11 CS]
Finished this Chapter. Generally able to understand it but feel like
there's whole lot more content underneath that as in the KS
transformation for example. There should be a lot tricks and methods to
construct such regularization. And I wonder what kind of singularity
could be regularized. But I guess that this is not an easy question and
should not be the emphasis to my project.


\item[2011-04-11 CS]
A trivial error: eq.~(6.13) should be ``$\sqrt{x}dx = 2dt$'',
rather than ``$\sqrt{x}dx = \sqrt{2}dt$''.

\item[2011-04-12 PC]
No error is 'trivial.' Thanks.

%%-----   Newton
\section{Chapter: Hamiltonian dynamics}
\label{c-newton}\noindent dasbuch/book/chapter/newton.tex
\begin{description}

\item[2012-01-02 CS to PC]
I am wondering how to choose phase space
coordinates? Do phase/state space coordinates have any requirement and
whether conservation of space volume is such a requirement? What's the
meaning of conservation of phase space requirement? In my understanding
in Hamiltonian flows, conservation of phase space volume means
conservation of energy, am I right?

\item[2012-01-02 PC]
Now, it is more subtle than that; time dependent flow can be symplectic,
but energy is not conserved; I think Percival and D.
Richards\rf{PerRich82N} (I have it in the
\HREF{http://www.cns.gatech.edu/CNS-only/LibraryCat2.htm} {CNS library})
discuss that well. Symplectic invariance is \emph{much stronger}
requirement than either either energy conservation or phase-space volume
conservation, see \HREF{http://chaosbook.org/chapters/newton.pdf}
{Section 7.4 Poincar\'e invariants} and
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/chapters/appendStability.pdf} {Appendix D.4
Stability of Hamiltonian flows}: symplectic transformations preserve area
for each $(q,p)$ dual coordinate  pair.

\label{c-discrete}\noindent dasbuch/book/chapter/discrete.tex
\begin{description}

\item[2011-03-30  CS to PC]
I have a question from the paragraph
following the definition of free action: The splitting of a group
\emph{G} into a stabilizer \emph{$G_{p}$} and \emph{m-1} coset
\emph{$cG_{p}$} relates to an orbit \emph{$M_{p}$} to \emph{m-1} other
distinct orbits \emph{$cM_{p}$}. All of them have equivalent stabilizers,
or more precisely, the points on the same group orbit have
\emph{conjugate stabilizers}: \emph{$G_{cp} = cG_{p}c^{-1}$}. For the
last sentence, does it mean that if \emph{$G_{p}$}  is a stabilizer of
\emph{$M_{p}$}, then \emph{$cG_{p}c^{-1}$} is a stabilizer of
\emph{$cM_{p}$}?

\item[2011-03-31 PC] Yes, you are right. I have now incorporated ``if
\emph{$G_{p}$}  is a stabilizer of \emph{$M_{p}$}, then
\emph{$cG_{p}c^{-1}$} is a stabilizer of \emph{$cM_{p}$}'' into
discrete.tex, thanks.

I intend to excise the dreaded word `stabilizer' from the text, just have
forgotten to do it
\HREF{http://www.flickr.com/photos/birdtracks/4259634492/in/set-72157606259014811/}
{[click]} here. Suggestion - print out the chapter, replace by hand word
`stabilizer' everywhere by 'symmetry' and let's sit together and see
whether the chapter is  easier to read.

\item[2011-04-19 CS]
BTW, any recommendation for a hands on book for Lie group and Lie
algebra? I think I need a deeper knowledge about this.

\item[2011-04-20 PC] I suggested in the siminos/blog/
that you check out a book from the library that Meiss recommends. Do it, see
whether it eases the pain. You can also get
Gilmore and Letellier\rf{GL-Gil07b}
{\em The Symmetry of Chaos} out of the CNS library. It only does the
invariant polynomial reduction (Siminos and I believe that is useless in
higher dimensions), but it is pretty good on discrete symmetries.

 = \sum\limits_{m=0}^{\infty}m^{2}(u_{1}^{(m)2}+u_{2}^{(m)2})

First, why would there be a integral on left hand side? Second, why the
integrand is $(\textbf{T}u(\theta))^{\emph{T}}\textbf{T}u(2\pi-\theta)$?
Shouldn't it be $(\textbf{T}u(\theta))^{\emph{T}}\textbf{T}u(\theta)$
according to eq. (10.11)?

\item[2011-04-20 PC] $u(\theta)$ is a function on the interval $[0,2\pi]$,
hence integral on the left side (LHS). Compact support, hence the infinite sum
on the RHS. If I remember right (check notes or the textbook from
our Math Methods course) for Fourier transforms, a convolution on the
left hand side gives me a product on the right hand side. If I'm wrong,
let me know so I fix this; as you say, does not look like $L^2$ norm...

About Example 12.3 H\'enon repeller complete horseshoe:
First, in figure 12.4, why after one step's evolution, point B occupies
point D's original spot and also point C and point D are in the stable
manifold? I do not think this is just a coincidence but still haven't
figure out the reason.

\item[2011-07-22 CS] I read the Smale Horseshoe part in Kai's thesis. Now
I understand why the binary sequence has to be assigned this way. Only in
this way can the symbol represent the actual map. It's hard to describe
it but this picture found from wiki helped me a lot.

I had noticed Demidov's website before - you are right, these simulations
are very instructive, I have now added a remark about them to ChaosBook.
He uses a different definition for parameters $a$ and $b$ from H\'enon,
but unfortunately uses the same letters. His definition is natural if one
is interested in Julia sets, but unfortunately not the one H\'enon used,
and I always try to follow the foundational papers, rather than confusing
everybody with sly parameter redefinitions.

Demidov's parametrization\rf{DemChaos} of the H\'enon map is:

\(
\frac{x_{n+1}'}{a'} = 1 + a'\left(\frac{x_n'}{a'}\right)^2 + b'\frac{y_n'}{a'}

You need the transformation between two definitions, if you are
going to use Demidov's simulations to test your ideas, and it helps greatly
if the transformation formula is the correct one. If

In \emph{Estimating long term behavior of flows without trajectory
integration: the infinitesimal generator approach}, \arXiv{1101.4166}
Gary Froyland, Oliver Junge and P\'eter Koltai write:
``
The long-term distributions of trajectories of a flow are described by
invariant densities, i.e. fixed points of an associated transfer
operator. In addition, global slowly mixing structures, such as
almost-invariant sets, which partition phase space into regions that are
almost dynamically disconnected, can also be identified by certain
eigenfunctions of this operator. Indeed, these structures are often hard
to obtain by brute-force trajectory-based analyses. In a wide variety of
applications, transfer operators have proven to be very efficient tools
for an analysis of the global behavior of a dynamical system.
The computationally most expensive step in the construction of an
approximate transfer operator is the numerical integration of many short
term trajectories. In this paper, we propose to directly work with the
infinitesimal generator instead of the operator, completely avoiding
trajectory integration. We propose two different discretization schemes;
a cell based discretization and a spectral collocation approach.
Convergence can be shown in certain circumstances. We demonstrate
numerically that our approach is much more efficient than the operator
approach, sometimes by several orders of magnitude.

\item[2012-09-13 Predrag] \emph{What does `kernel' mean in `integral kernel'?}
The English usage is a translation of the German `kern', meaning kernel,
core, nucleus, \ie, something central or essential. There are two usages
in mathematics, kernels of \emph{transforms}, and kernels of
\emph{mappings}. In integral equations and Fourier analysis the term was
first used by Fredholm (1903) and Hilbert (1904), referring to an
integrable generalization $K(x,y)$ of a matrix $M_{jk}$. The use in
algebra is unrelated, with `kernel' of a homomorphism being the inverse
image of the zero element, a synonym for `null-space' of a linear
transformation between vector spaces.

A particle moving deterministically in a chaotic spatially extended
environment can exhibit normal diffusion, with its mean square
displacement growing proportional to the time. Here we consider the
dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the size and the position of
dynamical channels (`holes') linking spatial regions. The system
properties can be obtained analytically via a Taylor-Green-Kubo formula
in terms of a functional recursion relation, leading to a diffusion
coefficient varying with the hole positions and non-monotonically on
their size. We derive analytic formulas for small holes in terms of
periodic orbits covered by the holes. The asymptotic regimes that we
observe show deviations from a simple random walk approximation, a
phenomenon that should be ubiquitous in dynamical systems and might be
observed experimentally. The escape rate of the corresponding open system
is also calculated. The resulting parameter dependencies are compared
with the ones for the diffusion coefficient and explained in terms of
periodic orbits.

$\nu$, and it should be the fastest introduction to \KSe.

\item[2011-08-28 Chao]

In the second paragraph of section 26.1.1, it is said ``KS equation is
Galilean invariant: if $u(x,t)$ is a solution, then $v+u(x+2vt,t)$ with
$v$ an arbitrary constant velocity is also a solution.'' So I substitute
$v+u(x+2vt,t)$ into KS equation given by 26.2, but it seems that the new
equation does not keep the original form with additional term $3vu_x$.
Would you please show me explicitly how this works?

\item[2011-08-30 Predrag] thanks for catching this typo, it should be
$v+u(x-vt,t)$. Corrected now.

\item[2011-08-28 Chao]
I do not understand the dimensional analysis in the following
paragraph. Why does time has the dimension of square of length? Why does
viscosity has the same dimension with time? Plus, where does
``viscosity'' show up in the original KS equation 26.2?

\item[2011-08-30 Predrag] thanks for catching this typo (I had not
entered the hyper-viscosity parameter $\nu$ in the defining equation).

\item[2011-08-28 Chao]
In the second paragraph of page 516, we obtain two equilibrium points and
each of them has totally three dimensional manifolds and three Floquet
multipliers. Since KS equation is one-dimensional, where are the two
other dimensions from? I saw that you put the two equilibrium points in
three-dimensional space and extend the coordinate to be $c_+ =
(\sqrt{c},0,0),c_- = (-\sqrt{c},0,0)$, but this does not bring in the
dependence on the other two dimensions, right?

\KSe\ is a PDE in one or two spatial dimensions, so it corresponds to an

the left-hand of the equation to zero, so the right hand side (in the 1
spatial dimension case \emph{only}) becomes a 4th order ODE in $d/dx$.
One integral you can do, so the system becomes a 3rd order ODE +
integration constant, or 3 first order ODEs. The best papers on this are

\item[2011-08-28 Chao]
Up to this point I am confused with another point that in Chapter 4, when
defining Floquet multipliers and stable/unstable manifold, we
introduced Jacobian matrix of continuous time-dependent map $f(x,t)$. We
expand the map f to first order and get Jacobian matrix as the
coefficient matrix. But here in KS system, we do not know the explicit
form of $f(x,t)$, which should be the solution. Then how do we deduce the
Jacobian matrix without knowing the map explicitly?

\item[2011-09-10 PC] You almost never have an explicit formula for the
\JacobianM, it is always a numerically computed linearized map. What you
do have is an explicit formula for the {\stabmat} ${\Mvar}$, in the case
of KS you have written it out in \refeq{KSstabMat2}.

name for it?

\item[2011-12-01 Jim Yorke to PC] The Kaplan Yorke Dimension is a formula
involving Lyapunov exponents. So we called the KY Dimension. No -- just
joking. We called it the Lyapunov Dimension. Logical?

\item[2011-12-01 PC to Jim Yorke] \emph{Who is the 2000th person who
invoked Lyapunov's name in vain?} Poor Lyapunov. He is a surname, not
concept, but his name gets attached to zillion things he had nothing to
do with.

There is something called ``Lyapunov equation'' which actually is in his
thesis, at least for the strictly contracting fixed point case.

Then there things like ``Lyapunov Covariant Vectors'' that he has nothing
to do with in any imaginable way which yield a ``physical dimension'' of
attractors of PDEs such as Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Landau-Ginzburg. That
DOES NOT count Lyapunov exponents, it counts non-hyperbolically connected
``Covariant Vectors'', and seems to give a number roughly twice the KY
dimension.

So I'll stick to calling the KY dimension  ``Kaplan Yorke dimension'', and
leave poor Belorussian aristocrat out of this.

\emph{Who is the 2nd person who invented General Relativity?}
(Answer: Who remembers?)

Dear Jim, I know you do not find renormalization in period doubling
important, but if you do mention it:


Feigenbaum discovered and fully formulated period-doubling universality
in 1975, you can click on the link to Feigenbaum's first report from 1976
\HREF{http://www.cns.gatech.edu/~predrag/papers/preprints.html\#Trans2chaos}{here}.
In 1981 Lanford satisfied himself that the iterative method we used and
knew was contracting was indeed contracting. He refers only to the
Feigenbaum paper.
\HREF{http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/21/74/80/PDF/ajp-jphyscol197839C513.pdf}
{Coullet and Tresser} refer to the Feigenbaum paper. It's there something
essential that is missing in the 1976 formulation?

I'm very fond of all three of them - all creative and crazy as bats. I
just do not get their names on the equation that was widely known and
publicized well before 1978?

As far as I can tell, Lyubich renamed the equations. I asked him why? He
wrote:

``In 90s, I talked to both Feigenbaum and Tresser, and my conclusion was
that Coullet-Tresser discovered the phenomenon independently, though
slightly later. Also, they seemed to recognize better importance of the
dynamical universality (while Feigenbaum focused more on  the parameter
phenomenon.) I felt that Coullet-Tresser did  not receive a proper credit
for their insights, so I attached all three names to the phenomenon.''

OK, that's nice. Feigenbaum and I do not recognize ``importance of the
dynamical universality'', whatever that might mean. While at it, why not
give credit to the guy who wrote the fixed point equation first? What am
I, dog meat? Never mind...

People reinvent stuff all the time. Myrheim and I generalized period
doubling to
\HREF{http://www.cns.gatech.edu/~predrag/papers/preprints.html\#ComplexRenorm}
{infinity of renomalizations} in the complex plane, but once I was told
that Golberg, Sinai and Khanin did it first (for period tripling), I
refer to them even though we discovered it without knowing that they did
it, both in 1983.

I agree with you - why attach any names to equations? Anyway, it's just
the way things are. Pretty soon the attribution problems will sort
themselves out by themselves - heart attacks and homicidal Atlanta
drivers will take care of that. Cheers \& red socks forever

(2013-02-25: superseded by \refref{Bagheri13}, find it
\HREF{http://ChaosBook.org/library/Bagheri13.pdf}{here}). He writes:
``
In this article we characterize the behavior of Koopman modes and
eigenvalues for flows developing and undergoing oscillations. In
particular, we focus on the saturation dynamics near the critical
threshold for oscillation, where the amplitude is governed by the
Stuart-Landau equation. The Koopman-mode theory is also valid far from
bifurcation, although it is not explicitly treated in this work. We will
assess a numerical algorithm referred to as Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD), in terms of its ability to approximate Koopman modes for transient
and asymptotic dynamics. The algorithm is scalable to very
high-dimensional systems and relies only on post-processing collected
data.
''

Discusses only systems where one
unstable focus $f (u_s) = 0$ co-exists with a stable limit cycle.

``Prior to Mezi\'c and Banaszuk (2004) and Mezi\'c (2005), essentially
all applied literature on evolution operators have focused on the
Perron-Frobenious operator. However, the Koopman operator $\Uop^t$, which is
adjoint to the Perron-Frobenious operator, is the appropriate evolution
operator to represent the dynamics of attractors and their stable
manifolds. The operator governs the evolution of scalar-valued
observables, such as the kinetic energy and probe signals, in some
functional space. Our essential ingredients for describing the flow
dynamics are the complex eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of $\Uop^t$. The
concept is best introduced by an example.'' He then gives explicit
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for
\beq
\dot{x}(t) = \mu x - x^3 \,,\qquad \mu  < 0
\,,
\ee{Bagh(1.1)}
as well as a 3\dmn\ flow of Noack \etal.
    \PC{This would be good problem set for ChaosBook?}

``An observable is a function that to each field $u$ associates a scalar.
In this paper, we consider bounded and smooth (i.e. physical) observable
functions. The vector-valued observable $\obser(u) : \pS \to \reals^m$ in
equation (2.1b) is defined as $\obser(u) = [g_1(u), g_2(u), . . . , g_m(u)]$,
where each component $g_j(u)$ is a scalar function over $\pS$. The time
evolution of $\obser(u)$ is governed by a convection equation (Lasota and
Mackey\rf{LM94})
\beq
\frac{\partial g}{\partial t}
= (f (u) \cdot \nabla)g = L g
\ee{Bagh(2.2)}
The above system is linear, time-invariant (since equation 2.1 is
autonomous) and infinite dimensional. Moreover, it is a hyperbolic
system, with the physical interpretation of an observable as a `passive
tracer'transported by the vector-field $f$. We formally write the
solution to \refeq{Bagh(2.2)} as
\[
\obser(u(t)) = \exp(\Aop t)\obser(u_0) = \Uop^t \obser(u_0),
\]
where the evolution operator $\Uop^t : S(\pS) \to S(\pS)$ is defined as the
Koopman operator\rf{K31,LM94}. In the theory of semigroups (Pazy 1983),
the linear operator $L$ is the infinitesimal generator of the operator
$\Uop^t$.

\item[2013-01-20 Predrag] Dear Shervin, thanks for sending me this paper
- I already have your \refref{RoMeBaSchHe09} on my 'to read' list,
but I have not studied it yet. Currently I have relegated Koopmanism
to an appendix, but it surely should be brought back into the main
text, so I'm very much looking forward to learning about all things
Koopman and more from you.

\wwwcb{} is supposed to cover all things chaotic and nonlinear that
an advanced grad student should know or at least have heard about, so
let's take a proactive stance: if you think there are formulas,
derivations, etc. in your papers I should read and include, please
tell me, and I'll do my schoolwork

BTW, as you are not referring to anything specific in Version 12, can
you change the (Cvitanovi\'c et al. 2008) citation to year 2013, no
version? And similarly for the referenced chapters, to Version 14?
From edition to edition ChaosBook changes substantively, but your
references to chapter names have not changed between these version.

Recently there are more and more papers which reproduce our work from
twenty years ago without a single citation, or (for example,
wikipedia entries) that misassign credit for almost every entry. I
did not care about it before (hey, I actually get paid for doing what
I love!), but I'm starting to care, mostly because I want people to
cite ChaosBook.org - it is meant to be more useful than the original
papers. So I turned into a kvetch, and wrote a very myopic history of
\wwwcb{/chapters/appendHist.pdf} {``Periodic orbit theory''} plus a
sarcastic \wwwcb{/chapters/recycle.pdf} {``Alternative Periodic Orbit
Theories''} remark. If you read them, and find something wrong in
them, please reign me in and let me know what to fix.

\item[2013-01-25 Predrag] Shervin, I have pondered using a stable
fixed point, and then the stable limit cycle as the first step in
motivating \Fd s. I do that for noisy flows in
\refrefs{LipCvi08,CviLip12} (not migrated to ChaosBook yet). It is
very intuitive and instructive for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck system,
with full set of Hermite-polynomial eigenfunctions, but the problem
here is (is it a problem?) that for stable fixed points the measure
is a Dirac delta on the fixed point / limit cycle. Set of (right?)
eigenfunctions is given in \refref{CBconverg} example ``The simplest
eigenspectrum - a single fixed point,'' but the left eigenfunctions
are buried later in the text as derivatives of delta functions, so
this is not very helpful, pedagogically. What to do?

So here, experimentally, I've edited (in ChaosBook.org notation) and
commented clips from your manuscript\rf{Bagheri13}. If it makes
sense, we might experimentally migrate this to Koopmania of
\wwwcb{/chapters/appendMeasure.pdf}. For long time I've felt guilty
to have exiled Koopman to an appendix, so maybe the whole thing might
return to the text proper. But that makes the book yet longer...
Uurgh.

\textbf{Multi-index notation}.
Define multi-index as an array of $d$ integers:
\[
\jb = [j_{1}, j_{2}, \dots, j_{d}] \in \naturals^d
\,,
\]
\ie, elements are positive integers $j_k=0,1,2,\dots$. Then
\[
\jb! = j_{1}! j_{2}! \cdots j_{d}!
\,,
\qquad
|\jb| = j_{1}+j_{2}+\cdots+j_{d}

and
\[
\partial^\jb = \df{^{j_{1}}}{x^{j_{1}}}\df{^{j_{2}}}{x^{j_{2}}}
            \dots\df{^{j_{d-1}}}{x^{j_{d-1}}}

For example, a product of $d-1$ complex numbers
\[
\ExpaEig =  \ExpaEig_{1} \ExpaEig_{2}  \cdots \ExpaEig_{d-1}
\,,

can now be raised to $\jb$th power as
\beq
\ExpaEig^\jb =  \prod_{k=1}^{d-1} \ExpaEig_{k}^{j_{k}}
             =  \ExpaEig_{1}^{j_{1}} \ExpaEig_{2}^{j_{2}},
                \cdots  \ExpaEig_{d-1}^{j_{d-1}}

The monodromy matrix  $\Mbf=\nabla \PoincM^{\cl{p}}(\sspRed_a)$
of dimension $(d-1)\times (d-1)$ governs the dynamics of the small
perturbation $\delta\sspRed$. If we order the eigenvalues of $\Mbf$
(also known as Floquet multipliers) as
    \PC{I number complex pairs consecutively, so not $<$ but $\leq$}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
%&&|\ExpaEig_j| <1 \qquad {\rm for}\qquad j=1,\dots,d-1
&& |\ExpaEig_{1}| \geq |\ExpaEig_2|\geq \dots \geq|\ExpaEig_{d-1}|,
\label{eq:general:exponent}
\end{eqnarray}
%
then the limit cycle is stable if  $|\ExpaEig_{1}|<1$.  The
two most important characteristics of the limit cycle are  thus the
fundamental frequency and the \PCedit{leading} Lyapunov exponent,
defined  by
    \PC{ChaosBook reserves $\period{p}$ for `little trace' (over
        prime cycle $p$), $\period{p}$ for the period. Also changed
        $\sigma_j$ to $\ExpaEig_j$, $\sigma$ (that looks awkward in
        your paper) to \Lyap, $s$ to $\PoincM$, $L$ to $\Aop$, $\Ubf$
        to $\sspRed$. I'm a
        bit confused about $\Aop$ at this moment - that I use for the
        \evOper\ {\Lop} - maybe it should be $\transp{\Aop}$,
        whatever that means?. All of these are macros, and can be
        reverted back to your notation.}
\begin{equation}
\omega = \frac{\period{p}}{2\pi}, \qquad
\Lyap=\frac{1}{\period{p}}\ln|\ExpaEig_1|,

%
respectively.

% \noindent{\bf Trace formula for a limit cycle} \\
The general trace formula derived in \refref{pexp}, %{1991CvitanovicEckhardt},
in the special case of  a single limit cycle is
%
\begin{equation}
\tr \Uop^t = \period{p}\sum_{r=1}^\infty \frac{\delta (t-r\period{p})}{|\det (\Ibf- \Mbf^r)|}.
\label{eq:traceFormula}
\end{equation}
%
The trace formula is a sum whose terms are nonzero only for integers
of the limit cycle period.  The $jth$ nonzero term describes how much
after the $jth$ return to the Poincar\'e section a small neighborhood
volume (\ie\  a tube) of the stable limit cycle has retracted. This
relation thus connects the trace of $\Uop^t$ to the dynamics in the
local stable manifold of the limit cycle.
    \PC{to Shervin - changed to Poincar\'e throughout}

The Koopman eigenvalues are the poles of the
Laplace transform of trace of $\Uop^t$
%
\[
\int_0^\infty e^{-\eigenvL\zeit} \tr \Uop^t dt =\tr \frac{1}{s-\Aop}
\,,
\]
%
\ie, the poles of the
resolvent of $\Aop$. By inserting \refeq{eq:traceFormula} in the
left-hand side of above equation one obtains,
    \PC{I call it \Fd\ when it includes the weight of an observable. I guess
    this might be a `Zeta function', but who called it that first?}
%
\[
\tr \frac{1}{\eigenvL-\Aop} = \df{}{\eigenvL} \ln (Z(\eigenvL)),
\]
%
where $Z(\eigenvL)$ is the Zeta function,
%
\[
Z(\eigenvL) = \exp \left [-\sum_{r=1}^\infty\frac {1}{r} \frac{e^{-\eigenvL\period{p} r}}{|\det(\Ibf-\Mbf^r)|}
         \right ].
\]
%
Now, since the determinant does not depend on the basis which $\Mbf$
is described in, we may write it in terms of the eigenvalues of
$\Mbf$,
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{|\det (\Ibf- \Mbf^r)|} = \prod_{k=1}^{d-1} \frac{1}{1-\ExpaEig_k^r},
\label{eq:prod2sum}
\end{equation}
%
where we have assumed that $|\ExpaEig_k|<1$ for all $k$. Note that
the Taylor series of the function $(1-x)^{-1}(1-y)^{-1} $ is
%
\[
(1-x)^{-1}(1-y)^{-1} = 1+x+y+ x^2 + xy + y^2+\dots,
\]
%
when $|x|<1,|y|<1$. Each term in the product \refeq{eq:prod2sum} may
thus be written as an infinite sum.
Using multi-index notation \refeq{multIndLambda} we may write
\refeq{eq:prod2sum} as
    \PC{Use the multi-index notation in ChaosBook}
    \PC{Shervin - Note that I have edited multi-index notation in
    half of your formulas - please recheck.}
%
\[
\frac{1}{|\det(\Ibf-\Mbf^r)|}
= \sum_{\jb} \ExpaEig^{r\jb}
\,,
\]
%
and consequently the Zeta function  as
%
\[
Z(\eigenvL) = \exp \left [-\sum_{r=1}^\infty\frac {1}{r}
  \left (e^{-\eigenvL\period{p}}  \sum_{\jb} \ExpaEig^\jb \right )^r
             \,\right].
\]
%
Finally,  applying the identity $\sum x^r/r= -\ln(1-x)$,  we obtain
the final form of the Zeta function for a stable limit cycle
%
%
\begin{equation}
Z(\eigenvL) 	= \prod_{\jb}^\infty
   \left [1-e^{-\eigenvL\period{p}} \ExpaEig^\jb\right],
\label{eq:app:zeta2}
\,.
\end{equation}
% with $\jb=[j_1,\dots,j_{d-1}]$.
%
The zeros $Z(\eigenvL)=0$ are given by the zeros of individual terms in the
product, \ie
%
\[
e^{-\eigenvL\period{p}}\prod_{k=1}^{d-1} \ExpaEig_k^{j_k} = 1, \qquad {j_k}=0,1,\dots
\]
%
Taking the logarithm of both sides, we obtain
    \PC{this works for complex multipliers as well, as
    \(\ExpaEig_k \ExpaEig_{k+1} = \ExpaEig_k \ExpaEig_k^* = |\ExpaEig_k|^2.\)}
%
\begin{equation}
\eigenvL_{\jb,m}=\frac{1}{\period{p}}\left ( \sum_{k=1}^{d-1} {j_k}\ln (\ExpaEig_k) + 2\pi i m\right )
\label{eq:app:tr:limit:final}
\end{equation}
%
with ${j_k}=0,1,\dots,$ and $m=0,\pm 1, \pm2, \dots $. For our
particular choice of analytic observables the spectrum of $\Uop^t$ is
reduced to its minimal components, namely any integer multiple of
the stability eigenvalues.
% The full Koopman spectrum is simply the union of all the Koopman
% eigenvalues for the unstable equilibrium
% \refeq{eq:app:tr:fixed:final} and the stable limit cycle
% \refeq{eq:app:tr:limit:final}.

%
Consider the cylinder flow at  $Re_{c,3D}>Re>Re_c$, where
$Re_{c,3D}=182$ is the critical Reynolds number for which the limit
cycle becomes unstable. Suppose that the frequency and the Lyapunov
exponent of limit cycle are $\omega$ and $\Lyap$ respectively.
%
Then, the Koopman eigenvalues $\eigenvL_{j_1,0,\dots,0,m}$ obtained
from  \refeq{eq:app:tr:limit:final} corresponding to this stability
eigenvalue are
%
\begin{equation}
\eigenvL_{j,m}  =  j \Lyap + im\omega, %= -j0.03 + i m 0.79,
\label{eq:tracePeriod}
\end{equation}
%
with $j=0,1,2\dots$ and $m=0,\pm1,\pm 2,\dots$.
%
Thus, for any stable limit cycle, the Koopman eigenvalues form a
lattice on the lower half of the complex plane. The marginal
eigenvalues on the horizontal imaginary axis corresponding to $j=0$
correspond to the non-decaying time-averaged mean ($m=0)$ and
periodic dynamics ($m\neq 0)$ on the limit cycle.
    \PC{I like `periodic dynamics' - it is Fourier decomposition of
    the initial density, which can rotate but cannot change, along
    the cycle in components $m$. Do I understand you right?}
The remaining
eigenvalues $j\neq 0$ are decaying and describe the transient
behavior of flow in the local stable manifold of the limit cycle.

\noindent{\bf Derivation of equation \refeq{eq:traceFormula}}\\
Here we follow the derivations  presented in
\refrefs{CBtrace,PG97}, % \cite{cvitanovic_ch18, gaspardBook},
    \PC{\refRef{PG97} follows \refref{pexp}, not sure it is
    any better than the original. Should recheck...}
except that the analysis is restricted to the simpler case of a
stable limit cycle. Using a Dirac-delta function, the Koopman
operator for any bounded observable function $\obser(\ub)$ can be written
as
%
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\Uop^t \obser(\ub) =
  \int_{\pS}\delta\left(\wb-\flow{t}{\ub}\right)\obser(\wb)d\wb
\,,
\end{equation}
%
where $\ub$ belongs to the manifold $\pS\subset\mathbb{R}^n$.
This form of the Koopman operator is similar to the form of integral
operators, for which one may define the trace as,
%
\[
\tr \Uop =\int_{\pS}\Uop(\ub,\ub)d\ub.
\]
%
where $\Uop$ is the kernel.
Inspired\footnote{
Integral operators are in $L^2$ space as well as compact, that is
they can in many aspects be treated as finite rank matrices. The
kernel of $\Uop^t$ is singular and the operator is certainly not in
$L^2$. However, if the dynamical system $\fb$ is real-analytic, it
has an analytic continuation to a complex extension of the state
space, where the singularity can be ``removed'' and the problem
reduced to the standard theory of integral operators\rf{CBconverg}.}
% \citep{cvitanovic_ch23}.}
by this definition, we define the trace of Koopman operator as
%
\begin{equation}
 \tr \Uop^t = \int_{\pS}\delta(\ub-\flow{t}{\ub})d\ub.
\label{eq:tr2}
\end{equation}
%
%
From \refeq{eq:tr2}, one observes that the trace of $\Uop^t$ counts
the number of times that trajectories return to their starting point
after $t$ time units.
    \PC{This does not `count'. See \wwwcb{/chapter/count.pdf}
    ``Topological zeta function for flows.''
    }
Note that the trace  is  a property of the
operator and independent of the observable.  From \refeq{eq:tr2}, it
is clear that the trace of $\Uop^t$ in only non-zero if $\ub=\flow{t}{\ub}$.
These trajectories are precisely those on the limit cycle or  the
equilibrium.

To proceed, we decompose the propagator $f_t$ into two parts, the
Poincar\'e map $\PoincM$ and a scalar function $\tau$.  The Poincar\'e map
captures only part of the periodic dynamics, since the flow component
tangent to the limit cycle, which is not in the span of the
Poincar\'e surface, has not \PCedit{been} taken into account.
%The longitudinal component does not affect the stability, since exactly after one period $\period{p}$ the trajectory returns to its initial position, e.g.\  there is no decay or growth of perturbations along the tangential direction,  which would yield a Jacobian matrix that equals one.
%Although, this  longitudinal component does not affect the stability it is necessary for the description of the full dynamics, which means that it is significant for determining the Koopman eigenvalues.
Assuming the longitudinal state component has a certain mean velocity
$v$ as it traverses the limit cycle, one may transform this component
to a time coordinate system using the relation $v dt$.  Thus the full
dynamics is described by the Poincar\'e map $\PoincM$ and by some function
$\tau(\sspRed)$  that provides the (non-constant) time interval between
successive points $\sspRed$ on Poincar\'e surface, e.g. $t_{k+1}  = t_k
+ \tau(\sspRed_k).$
    \PC{`some function' = `first return function'. See \wwwcb{/chapter/maps.pdf}
    ``Poincar\'e sections.''
    }
%
%
Applying $\tau$ recursively, we may write ($k+1)th$ time as a
function first point and initial time,
%
\begin{eqnarray}
 t_{k+1}  = t _1+ \sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\tau(\PoincM^j\sspRed_1).
 \label{eq:poirec2}
\end{eqnarray}
%
%The fixed point  $\sspRed_a$ in \refeq{eq:fixedPoint} correspond to a
%point on the limit cycle with the period,
%%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%  \period{p}  &=& \sum_{j=1}^{k_p}\tau(\PoincM^j\sspRed_1).
%\end{eqnarray}
%

%
%In section \ref{sec:stability:periodic}, we determined the stability of a limit cycle in terms of the  eigenvalues of the linearized Poincar\'e map.  One can make use of that analysis to write the trace as a function of the Jacobian matrix $\Mbf$. However, this is only part of the dynamics, since the flow component tangent to the limit cycle, which is not in the span of the Poincar\'e surface, has not be taken into account.
%The longitudinal component does not affect the stability, since exactly after one period $\period{p}$ the trajectory returns to its initial position, e.g.\  there is no decay or growth of perturbations along the tangential direction,  which would yield a Jacobian matrix that equals one.  Nevertheless longitudinal direction is necessary for the description of the full dynamics, and hence it contributes to the trace of $\Uop^t$.
 %
Now, decompose the kernel of $\Uop^t$ \refeq{eq:tr2} into two parts
%
\begin{equation}
\tr \Uop^t = \int_{\mathcal{P(\ub)}=0}d\sspRed \int_0^{\tau(\sspRed)} dt \delta \left (\sspRed-\PoincM^{k}\sspRed\right ) \delta \left (t-\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\tau(\PoincM^j\sspRed)\right ),
\label{eq:app:kerfac}
\end{equation}
%
where $\PoincM^k$ and $\tau$ are defined in \refeq{eq:poirec} and
\refeq{eq:poirec2}, respectively.  We treat the two Dirac delta
functions separately, starting with $\PoincM^k$. First recall that the
Dirac delta function applied to a scalar-valued function $\obser(x)$,
is
%
\[
\int \delta (g(x)) dx = \int \delta (x) |g'(0)^{-1}| du =  \sum_j\frac{1}{|g'(x_j)|},
\]
%
where $x_j$ are the roots of $g(x)$. This property may be generalized
to $d-1$ dimensions and applied to the first Dirac-delta in
\refeq{eq:app:kerfac},
%
\begin{equation}
\int_{\mathcal{P}(\ub)=0}\delta(\sspRed-\PoincM^{k}(\sspRed))d\sspRed = \frac{1}{|\det (\Ibf- \Mbf^r)|},
\label{eq:app:det0}
\end{equation}
%
where $\Ibf$ denotes the identity matrix.   The second part of the
trace can be written as\rf{CBtrace} % \citep{cvitanovic_ch18}
%
\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{\tau(\sspRed)}\delta (t-\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\tau(\PoincM^j\sspRed))d t
   =\period{p} \sum_{r=1}^\infty\delta (t-r\period{p}).
\label{eq:app:fac2lim}
\end{equation}
%
%
Inserting the  identities \refeq{eq:app:det0} and
\refeq{eq:app:fac2lim} in \refeq{eq:app:kerfac}, we get the trace
formula for a single limit cycle,
    \PC{Shervin, here you used $T_p$, not $t_p$}
%
\begin{equation}
\tr \Uop^t = \period{p}\sum_{r=1}^\infty \frac{\delta (t-r\period{p})}{|\det (\Ibf- \Mbf^r)|},
\label{eq:traceFormula0}
\end{equation}
%
which was first derived in \refref{pexp}. %{1991CvitanovicEckhardt}.
