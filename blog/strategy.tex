\section{Papers to write}

\subsection{Phys Rev E: Symmetry reduction"}

\medskip\noindent{\bf 2009-05-21 Vaggelis:}
I think we can now write a paper with title "Symmetry
reduction in high dimensional flows" that contains the
following:

* CLE reduction both with transverse integration and with the
moving frame method, including construction of return maps
(almost did this with transverse integration before I left
Atlanta).

* People do not understand what is the point of all this
without a high dimensional example, so we should also
include: Reduction for KS applied to the unstable manifold of
TW1 both with transverse integration (I will give it a try,
no more objections) and with moving frame method. No return
map for KS or discussion of dynamics and recurrence as this
will be the subject of the second KS paper.

The reason I don't want to through away moving frames and the
modified invariants is that I think I can now motivate the
modifications a bit better and because a better and less
arbitrary implementation might come out if they are not just
abandoned.

\item[2008-07-18 Predrag] about webtools for generating BibTeX:
www.zotero.org
        will pick up most books from Amazon, etc; but
        better to find a book first on
\HREF{http://www.worldcat.org}{www.worldcat.org}
          or
\HREF{http://scholar.google.com}{scholar.google.com}, then zotero it
          in a collection, and export in BibTeX format

\item[2009-12-22 Evangelos]
What do you think about setting up a cns group at zotero:
\HREF{http://www.zotero.org/blog/synchronize-pdfs-and-collaborate-with-zotero/}
{www.zotero.org/blog/synchronize-pdfs-and-collaborate-with-zotero}
  to keep track of important and hard of find papers?

\item[2010-01-07 Predrag] Sounds great, would not mind paying 20 bucks for the
storage. The only thing is - have not found it yet in their FAQs
\begin{enumerate}
   \item access should
be controlled by a group administrator, as materials are copyrighted.
  {\bf ES} My understanding is this is true.
   \item should maintain siminos.bib in the format we have now, the
crap zotero sticks into ziminoz.bib drives me nuts.
  {\bf ES} There is some script that controls export of bib files
      and it is user-tunable. The problem is it might require lots
      of work -- I have no time for hacking.
\end{enumerate}
Why don't you play with a potential CNS zotero group site for a while,
see how it works? {\bf ES} Will do and blog about it.
\item{2010-02-05 ES}
I've experimentally set up a cns zotero group.

\begin{tabular}{rl}
 User name 	& cns\\
 pass 		& you don't need it for access\\
 email 		& vaggelis.siminos@gmail.com (temporary)\\
Group name 	& cns\\
group site 	& \HREF{http://www.zotero.org/groups/cns}
                   {http://www.zotero.org/groups/cns} \\
 info   	& \HREF{http://www.zotero.org/documentation/quick_start_guide}
              {Zotero - Quick Start Guide}\\
\end{tabular}\\

To subscribe to it you will need a free zotero account, register
\HREF{https://www.zotero.org/user/register/}{here}. Then navigate
to the group \HREF{http://www.zotero.org/groups/cns}{site} and
ask to become member of the group. To sync with the library you
will need to enable syncing at your zotero firefox plugin preferences.

There are only some test entries in the library right now, we will need
to think a bit about the structure before creating collections. So it's
better not to invite more people to use it right now.

Group access options are:
\begin{description}
 \item[Public, Open Membership] Anyone can view your group online and join the group instantly.
 \item[Public, Closed Membership] Anyone can view your group online, but members must apply or be invited.
 \item[Private Membership] Only members can view your group online and must be invited to join.
\end{description}

ES has chosen Public, Closed Membership. I've also fine tuned the settings so that anyone in the
web can see the database, but only group members can change the database and see attachments, that
is pdf files. We can also restrict the privilege to change entries and files to group admins. This would
prevent accidental loss of data due to someone not knowing what he is doing, but then it won't be
possible for members to easily contribute entries.

\item[2010-01-07 ES] I'am leaning towards using tags rather than collections to organize the content
of my libraries but I am not sure about CNS library. I've been using collections for a while now
and the main problem is that many papers can fit to several collections.
So I either have to copy papers to all possible collections, or I end up having to browse
through multiple collections to find a paper.

The problem is that the web-interface does not display tags and does not support search as far as I can
tell. So one would have to use his zotero client to access the papers in a sensible way. Furthermore
since there is no obvious organization it would be hard to browse the library. So I think it would be
better to use both tags and an organization to collections.

\item[2010-05-13 Evangelos]
I think this is a good opportunity to test zotero cns library, so I've been uploading these
papers. Please check whether you can sync with the library.

\item[2010-05-12 PC] I seem to be able to access the papers on
\HREF{http://www.zotero.org/groups/cns}
{http://www.zotero.org/groups/cns} as user predrag@nbi.dk. Little creaky
- shows things like "APS Full Text PDF" which turns out to be a GaTech
library link to a Phys Rev Lett. They seem all correctly listed in
\HREF{http://www.zotero.org/groups/cns/items}
{http://www.zotero.org/groups/cns/items}, though.

I seem to be syncing, in the sense that my firefox zotero add-on
does show the cns library. Have not tried uploading a
anything yet.

\item[2010-05-12 ES] They seem to have two levels for the attachments. 
Links look like:

APS Full Text PDF  (pdf, 618 KB) 

They provide details and the link by which the files were downloaded if you press
on APS Full Text PDF. They provide the stored copy of the file if you press
on (pdf, 618 KB). I find it easier to use the firefox add-on to get the attachments though.

I see Predrag added something to the library, a webpage on Optimal Experiments? I do not
have access to it though. The best  way to add something to the library
is to drag it from your personal library and drop it to cns library within the zotero plugin.
