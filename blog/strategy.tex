\section{How to read me}

Throughout:  {\textdollar} on the margin
{\steady}
indicates that the text has been transferred to
articles and thesis siminos/*/,  or to ChaosBook.org desymmetrization
chapters, such as
\HREF{http://ChaosBook.org/continuous.pdf}
{continuous.pdf}.
%
For those whose Freud needs brushing up:
`Desymmetrization and its discontents' is a pun
on \HREF{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_and_Its_Discontents}
{Civilization and its discontents}.

Here is a novice's guide to desymmetrization bloggery:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
How to read the running blog: go first to the latest blog post, end
of \refchap{c-DailyBlog}.
  \item
If you are reading an article of common interest (which does not fit into
one of the specialized topics), enter your notes into \refchap{c:lit}.
  \item
\refChap{c-freeze} \emph{Deep freeze} is the blog for the putative
\texttt{siminos/ksReduced/}
article, spearheaded by Evangelos
  \item
Comments to ChaosBook.org go into \refchap{chap:ChaosBook} blog.
  \item
Periodic orbit theory comments belong to \refchap{chap:UPO} {\em
Periodic orbit theory}.
  \item
If Hamiltonian dynamics is your obsession, that's in
\refchap{sect:LiePolice} {\em Lie police}.
  \item
Slicing all things laser should be confined to
\refchap{chap:lasers}{Laser physics: The lingo}
  \item
Symmetry reduction in fluid dynamics is in \refchap{chap:fluids}{Fluids}
  \item
Guys counting the number of degrees of freedom that capture the physics
of a `turbulent' PDE have gotten a divorce. All Kazzmania now resides in
\texttt{siminos/lyapunov/}.
  \item
Ditto for geophysicists. They reside in
\texttt{siminos/baroclinic/BrCv12.tex}.
  \item
Guys writing the ultimate guide to slicing for the woman on the street,
\texttt{siminos/atlas/}, blog in \refchap{chap:atlas}{\em Atlas}.
  \item
Plumbers who ponder how to slice experimental data blog in
\refchap{c-exp} {\em Symmetry reduction of experimental data}
  \item
Enter your ponderings on all things norm into \refsect{sect:norms}
\emph{Norms, distances}, though some of that is also in \refchap{c:lit}
(for experimental data) and \refchap{sect:LiePolice} (for symplectic
distances).
  \item
Cardiologists (mere electricians, really) have gotten a divorce, too. That
blog's gone to \texttt{DOGS/saldana/excite.tex}.
  \item
All things `{geometric phase}' are in \refchap{c-geometric} {\em
Geometric phase}.

\end{itemize}

\item[2008-07-18 Predrag] about webtools for generating BibTeX:
www.zotero.org
        will pick up most books from Amazon, etc; but
        better to find a book first on
\HREF{http://www.worldcat.org}{www.worldcat.org}
          or
\HREF{http://scholar.google.com}{scholar.google.com}, then zotero it
          in a collection, and export in BibTeX format

\item[2009-12-22 Evangelos]
setting up a cns group at zotero.org

\item[2011-08-16 Predrag] moved the instructions to siminos/bibtex/zotero.txt
