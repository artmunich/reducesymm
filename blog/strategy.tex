\subsection{Papers to write}

\medskip\noindent{\bf 2009-05-21 Vaggelis:}
I think we can now write a paper with title "Symmetry
reduction in high dimensional flows" that contains the
following:

* CLE reduction both with transverse integration and with the
moving frame method, including construction of return maps
(almost did this with transverse integration before I left
Atlanta).

* People do not understand what is the point of all this
without a high dimensional example, so we should also
include: Reduction for KS applied to the unstable manifold of
TW1 both with transverse integration (I will give it a try,
no more objections) and with moving frame method. No return
map for KS or discussion of dynamics and recurrence as this
will be the subject of the second KS paper.

The reason I don't want to through away moving frames and the
modified invariants is that I think I can now motivate the
modifications a bit better and because a better and less
arbitrary implementation might come out if they are not just
abandoned.
