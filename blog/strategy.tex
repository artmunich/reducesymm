\section{How to read me}

For those whose Freud needs brushing up:
`Desymmetrization and its discontents' is a pun
on \HREF{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_and_Its_Discontents}
{Civilization and its discontents}.

Throughout:  {\footnotesize inCB} on the margin                 \inCB
indicates that the text has been transferred to an
article in siminos/*/,  or to ChaosBook.org
chapters, such as
\HREF{http://ChaosBook.org/chapters/continuous.pdf}
{continuous.pdf}.
 {\footnotesize 2CB} on the margin indicates that the text
still needs to be transferred an article or ChaosBook.org.      \toCB

This \texttt{blog.pdf} file is \emph{hyperlinked}.
There is a bunch of handy links throughout,
now that we went to the trouble of downloading papers and stealing books. Brilliant.
For example, if you click on
this: \arXiv{1103.4536}, you might find a interesting paper to read.
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/library/KoSa11.pdf}{Clicking here} will
lead you to our internal ChaosBook.org/library:
You'll need to log in as \texttt{student} and then enter \texttt{Lautrup}.
\HREF{http://www.zotero.org/groups/cns}{Zotero.org} is great,
but as only Evangelos and Predrag use it right now,
it is faster to stick stuff into ChaosBook.org library.

Here is a novice's guide to desymmetrization bloggery:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
How to read the running blog: go first to the latest blog post, end
of \refchap{c-DailyBlog}.
  \item
If you are reading an article of common interest (which does not fit into
one of the specialized topics), it might be already in \refchap{c:lit};
in nay case, enter your notes at the end of \refchap{c-DailyBlog}.
  \item
Comments to ChaosBook.org go into \refchap{chap:ChaosBook} blog.
  \item
Periodic orbit theory comments belong to \refchap{chap:UPO} {\em
Periodic orbit theory}.
  \item
If Hamiltonian dynamics is your obsession, that's in
\refchap{sect:LiePolice} {\em Lie police}.
  \item
Slicing all things laser should be confined to
\refchap{chap:lasers} {\em Laser physics: The lingo}
  \item
Symmetry reduction in fluid dynamics is in \refchap{chap:fluids} {Fluids}
  \item
Geophysicists reside in
\texttt{siminos/baroclinic/BrCv12.tex}.
  \item
Guys writing the ultimate guide to slicing for the woman on the street,
\texttt{siminos/atlas/}, blog in \refchap{chap:atlas} {\em Atlas}.
  \item
Plumbers who ponder how to slice experimental data blog in
\refchap{c-exp} {\em Symmetry reduction of experimental data}.
  \item
Enter your ponderings on all things norm into \refsect{c-norms}
\emph{Norms, distances}, though some of that is also in \refchap{c:lit}
(for experimental data) and \refchap{sect:LiePolice} (for symplectic
distances).
  \item
Cardiologists (mere electricians, really) have gotten a divorce, too. That
blog's gone to \texttt{DOGS/saldana/excite.tex}.
  \item
All things `{geometric phase}' are in \refchap{c-geometric} {\em
Geometric phase}.

\end{itemize}

\section{Zoteromania}

\begin{description}

\item[2008-07-18 Predrag] about webtools for generating BibTeX:
www.zotero.org
        will pick up most books from Amazon, etc; but
        better to find a book first on
\HREF{http://www.worldcat.org}{www.worldcat.org}
          or
\HREF{http://scholar.google.com}{scholar.google.com}, then zotero it
          in a collection, and export in BibTeX format

\item[2009-12-22 Evangelos]
setting up a cns group at zotero.org

\item[2011-08-16 Predrag] moved the instructions to siminos/bibtex/zotero.txt

\end{description}

\section{Git with it}

\begin{description}

\item[2013-07-07 Predrag] Divakar says I have to do it:
    svn is so 20th century now we must git it, so I'm taking a part of
    siminos repository, converting this
    \texttt{svn} repository to \texttt{git}, pruning most of it, and
starting a new theory graduate student Burak (Nazmi B. Budanur
<burakbudanur@gmail.com>) on it. One can continue working on the svn
repository using
    \HREF{http://mojodna.net/2009/02/24/my-work-git-workflow.html}
    {this web page}, but here my ambition is
    \HREF{http://thomasrast.ch/git/git-svn-conversion.html} {only one
    way},
    \HREF{http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-and-Other-Systems-Migrating-to-Git}
    {to create} a git repository, and work from then onward only within
    \texttt{git}. Did this in linux rather than windows, seems easier.

The author map \texttt{users.txt} is a text file
\begin{verbatim}
 svn log svn://zero.physics.gatech.edu/siminos |
 sed -ne 's/^r[^|]*|
 \([^ ]*\) |.*$/\1 = \1 <\1@zero.physics.gatech.edu>/p' |
 sort -u > users.txt
\end{verbatim}
that maps SVN usernames
to real names and email addresses for the git
history, with lines of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
svnuser = R. E. Alname <real@email.example.com>
\end{verbatim}
The result is pretty useless so it easier to create it by copying from svn@zero
editing:
\begin{verbatim}
repos/siminos/hooks/emaildict
\end{verbatim}
The project \texttt{reducesymm} is branchless (consists only of a single line of history), so:
\begin{verbatim}
git svn clone -A users.txt --no-metadata \
svn://zero.physics.gatech.edu/siminos reducesymm
\end{verbatim}
add your new Git server as a remote and push to it.
Here is an example of adding github.com server as a remote:
\begin{verbatim}
git remote add origin \
https://user:'Password'@github.com/user/reducesymm.git
\end{verbatim}
To have all branches and tags go up, first update local rep (pull),
then push to the server
\begin{verbatim}
git pull origin --all
git push origin --all
git push origin --tags
\end{verbatim}
All branches and tags are now on the Git server in a nice,
clean import.

\item[2013-08-08 Burak]
I started the
\HREF{https://groups.google.com/forum/\#!forum/reducesymm} {Google group} for  commits.

On github project page
\HREF{https://github.com/cvitanov/reducesymm}
{github.com/cvitanov/reducesymm}, do the following:

Settings (last item on the side bar) -> Service Hooks -> E-mails

If you add,

\texttt{reducesymm@googlegroups.com}

don't check the box [send from author], checking the box [Active]

The google group should start to get notifications on commits and
distribute it to members.  You can check it by clicking on Test Hook on
this page.

This is based on
\HREF{http://www.dynamis-technologies.com/blog/send-github-commits-to-a-google-group/}
{this blog post}.
When someone joins
to project, the person should also be made a member of the
\HREF{https://groups.google.com/forum/\#!forum/reducesymm} {Google group}.
This should take 3 or 4 clicks, one copy/paste and a captcha.

Who's member ``noreply", joined Aug 7, 2013? Apparently Burak? That's not very informative...
