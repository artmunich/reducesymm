\section{May 17, 2007 -- $s_1$, $s_2$, $\tau_x$, $\tau_z$ generate 16 irreps?}

{\bf PC}: My main problem is - we are currently using only 4 irreducible reps
of $C_2 \times C_2$ = $D_2$ dihedral group generated by $\tau_x, \tau_z$,
but why not 16 irreps of
the $D_2 \times D_2$ generated by $s_1, s_2, \tau_x, \tau_z$?
They all commute, each one splits the space of reps into 2.
Why stop at $U_S$ subspace?
There should be 16 discrete copies of any
general solution, not just 4.
However, there would still be 4 copies of UB, as UB is within the
fully symmetric irrep $A_1$ od $s_1, s_2$ $D_4$.

\section{Jun 13, 2007 Reading for Ruslan?}

Armbruster {\em et. al} showed that four complex Fourier
modes suffice to exhibit most
of the qualitative features of the dynamics,
for a wide range of system sizes\rf{AGHks89}.

\subsection{PC Nov 28, 2007: Japanese heresy}

We do not want to refer to wrong papers, but here it is, for
the internal record, so we do not forget not to cite it
(from Physical Review Letters, 16 Sep 2004 request to referee, 
which I ignored):

Mitsuhiro Kawasaki and Shin-ichi Sasa,
    ``Statistics of unstable periodic orbits of a chaotic dynamical system
    with a large number of degrees of freedom."


\section{Symmetry-Reduced Representation (SRR) for KSE}

\subsection{RLD Jan 17, 2008 -- How to quotient the SO(2) symmetry}

In order to quotient the SO(2) symmetry we need to be able to define,
for any state of the KS system $u(x)$
($a = (a_1, a_2, \ldots)^\mathsf{T}$ in Fourier space),
a 'shift' parameter, $s(a) \in S^1 $, such that
\[ \tau_{-s(a)} a \in M/\mathrm{SO}(2). \]
This parameter must satisfy the following {\em monotonicity condition} with
respect to the translation of the state $a$:
\[ s(\tau_{\ell/L}a) = s(a) + \phi(\ell/L) \]
where $\phi(x): S^1 \mapsto S^1$ should be a continuous strictly monotonic function.
This condition is necessary to avoid any ambiguity in the definition of
the shift parameter.

This condition is clearly satisfied when $s(a)$ is proportional to
the first Fourier mode (provided that $|a_1| > 0$)
\begin{equation}
  s(a) =  \theta_1/(2\pi) = \arg(\hat{e}_1^\dagger\,a)/(2\pi)
\label{eq:shift1} \end{equation}
where $\hat{e}_1 = (1+0i, 0, 0, \ldots)^\mathsf{T}$ is the basis vector corresponding
to the first Fourier mode and $\dagger$ denotes Hermitian transpose.
In this case
\[ \arg (e_1^\dagger\,\tau_{\ell/L}a)/(2\pi) = \theta_1/(2\pi) + \ell/L\,, \]
and so $\phi(x) = x$.

It is also possible to get a well-defined shift parameter by
using the difference between phases of Fourier modes $k$ and $k+1$ (provided
that $|a_k|, |a_{k+1}| > 0$):
\begin{equation}
  s(a) = \arg(\hat{e}_{k+1}^\dagger\,a)/(2\pi) -
  \arg(\hat{e}_{k}^\dagger\,a)/(2\pi)\,.
  \label{eq:shiftk} \end{equation}
Maybe for $L = 22$, where dominant Fourier modes are 2 and 3, it is better to use
this shift parameter with $k = 2$?  This needs to be explored.

Of course, as suggested by Predrag, we can define in a similar
fashion the shift parameter with respect to any other
state (e.g. an equilibrium state $a_q$):
\[ s(a) = \arg(a_q^\dagger\, a)/(2\pi)\,, \]
but this shift cannot be guaranteed to satisfy the
monotonicity condition for all $a$.

Since equilibria E1, E2, and E3 for $L = 22$ have dominant
1st, 2nd, and 3rd Fourier modes, respectively, fixing the modes by
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:shift1}) or (\ref{eq:shiftk}) also fixes the equilibria.


\subsection{PC Jan 17, 2008 -- Monotonicity?}

Not sure about need for monotonicity - one needs it for the 1-dimensional
Lie group of time evolution, parameterized by a continuous parameter $t$
which can be conjugated to any other parameter $u = u(t,\ssp)$ as long
as it is monotone, but rotations can go whichever way they want, modulo
$2\pi$ (or $L$). Once we look at a problem with $SO(3)$ symmetry, what's the
need for monotonicity in Euler angles, \etc.?

\subsection{RLD Jan 17, 2008 -- I think we need it...}
Let's say $s(a)$ is defined in such a way that it is not monotonic with respect to
shifts of state $a$.  Then there could exist $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2 \neq \ell_1$ such that
\[ s(\tau_{\ell_1/L}\,a) = s(\tau_{\ell_2/L}\,a) = s\,. \]
Then $\tau_{\ell_1/L - s}\,a$ and $\tau_{\ell_2/L - s}\,a$ would be two distinct points
in $M$/SO(2) representing the same state $a$.  This doesn't seem right.
