Creagh\rf{Creagh94},
{\em Quantum zeta function for perturbed cat maps}, says: ``
The behavior of semiclassical approximations to the spectra of perturbed
quantum cat maps is examined as the perturbation parameter brings the
corresponding classical system into the nonhyperbolic regime. The
approximations are initially accurate but large errors are found to
appear in the traces and in the coefficients of the characteristic
polynomial after nonhyperbolic structures appear. Nevertheless, the
eigenvalues obtained from them remain accurate up to large perturbations.

Wisniacki \etal\rf{WiVeBeBo04},
{\em Classical invariants and the quantization of chaotic systems}, says: ``
Due to their exponential proliferation, long periodic orbits constitute a
serious drawback in Gutzwiller's theory of chaotic systems. Therefore, it
would be desirable that other classical invariants, not suffering from
the same problem, could be used in alternative semiclassical quantization
schemes. In this Rapid Communication, we demonstrate how a suitable
dynamical analysis of chaotic quantum spectra unveils the role played, in
this respect, by classical invariant areas related to the stable and
unstable manifolds of short periodic orbits.

Heusler \etal\rf{HeMuAlBrHa07},
{\em Periodic-orbit theory of level correlations}, says: ``
We present a semiclassical explanation of the so-called
Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture which asserts universality of spectral
fluctuations in chaotic dynamics. We work with a generating function
whose semiclassical limit is determined by quadruplets of sets of
periodic orbits. The asymptotic expansions of both the nonoscillatory and
the oscillatory part of the universal spectral correlator are obtained.
Borel summation of the series reproduces the exact correlator of
random-matrix theory.

Ando \etal\rf{AnBoAi07},
{\em Automatic control and tracking of periodic orbits in chaotic systems}, says: ``
Based on an automatic feedback adjustment of an additional parameter of a
dynamical system, we propose a strategy for controlling periodic orbits
of desired periods in chaotic dynamics and tracking them toward the set
of unstable periodic orbits embedded within the original chaotic
attractor. The method does not require information on the system to be
controlled, nor on any reference states for the targets, and it overcomes
some of the difficulties encountered by other techniques. Assessments of
the method's effectiveness and robustness are given by means of the
application of the technique to the stabilization of unstable periodic
orbits in both discrete- and continuous-time systems.

Brack \etal\rf{BrOgYuRe05},
{\em Uniform semiclassical trace formula for
U(3) $\to$ SO(3) symmetry breaking}, says: ``
We develop a uniform semiclassical trace formula for the density of
states of a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator (HO),
perturbed by a term which term breaks the U (3) symmetry of the HO,
resulting in a spherical system with SO (3) symmetry.
We obtain an analytical uniform trace formula
which in the limit of strong perturbations (or high energy)
asymptotically goes over into the correct trace formula of the full
anharmonic system with SO (3) symmetry, and in the other limit
restores the HO trace formula with U (3) symmetry.

This might be useful to us in leading us to physically interesting systems
with non-abelian symmetries. However, have no time today to continue...

Mark Srednicki has several interesting recent papers on Riemann zeros.
In {\em Nonclasssical Degrees of Freedom in the Riemann Hamiltonian},
\arXiv{1105.2342},
he says: ``
The Hilbert-Polya conjecture states that the imaginary parts of the zeros of
the Riemann zeta function are eigenvalues of a quantum hamiltonian. If so,
conjectures by Katz and Sarnak put this hamiltonian in Altland and Zirnbauer's
universality class C. This implies that the system must have a nonclassical
two-valued degree of freedom. In such a system, the dominant primitive periodic
orbits contribute to the density of states with a phase factor of -1, which
partially resolves a previously mysterious sign problem for oscillatory
contributions to the density of the Riemann zeros.

\item[2011-05-16 Predrag] I believe that Ruelle's linear response
theory is fundamentally wrong, as deterministic diffusion transport
coefficients are nowhere differentiable.
Lucarini \etal\ do like it. In
{\em Relevance of sampling schemes in light of Ruelle's linear response
 theory}, \arXiv{1105.2527}, they say: ``
We reconsider the theory of the linear response of non-equilibrium steady
states to perturbations. We first show that by using a general functional
decomposition for space-time dependent forcings, we can define elementary
susceptibilities that allow to construct the response of the system to general
perturbations. Starting from the definition of SRB measure, we then study the
consequence of taking different sampling schemes for analyzing the response of
the system. We show that only a specific choice of the time horizon for
evaluating the response of the system to a general time-dependent perturbation
allows to obtain the formula first presented by Ruelle. We also discuss the
special case of periodic perturbations, showing that when they are taken into
consideration the sampling can be fine-tuned to make the definition of the
correct time horizon immaterial. Finally, we discuss the implications of our
results in terms of strategies for analyzing the outputs of numerical
experiments by providing a critical review of a formula proposed by Reick.

Gao, Xie and Lan\rf{GaXiLa11}
accelerate convergence of cycle expansions by dynamical conjugacies.

The key idea of this paper, of replacing the stability of an unstable
fixed-point or periodic orbit that a critical point is preperiodic to, by
the root corresponding to the order of the critical point was developed
in detail in a careful study of convergence by Artuso \etal\rf{AACII},
where it is shown that the change in convergence is due to a single fixed
point whose preimage is the critical point. It is shown how to modify the
cycle expansion to fix the convergence. The original $1/\zeta$ is kept,
but the pole induced by the critical point singularity is explicitly
factored out. The method is essentially a quadratic conjugacy restricted
to the critical point (Ulam map to tent map being the trivial example).

The innovation of this paper that goes beyond \refref{AACII} is the
explicit study of natural measures of such maps and use of conjugacies to
excise the singularities in the Ulam map (and its Misiurowicz family
generalization) settings. While \refref{AACII} motivates excision of the
singularity by a detailed study of many families of periodic orbits, the
authors accomplish this more elegantly, by a simple, well designed
conjugacy.

They are looking at the series of generalized Ulam maps, or what Ruelle
calls ``Misiurewicz maps'', where the critical point is preperiodic to,
ie  mapped onto an unstable cycle and thus rendered non-contracting.
Period 2 below is the next in sequence. The interesting new one is the
``Golden mean'' map, see for example exercise 11.6 in ChaosBook.org.
There the critical point is a part of the 3-cycle, so you know (at least
numerically) where the 3 measure singularities are. The answer is
somewhere in the literature. Perhaps in L.~Billings and E.~M.~Bollt,
``Invariant densities for skew tent maps,'' Chaos Solitons and Fractals
12, 365 (2001).

The step in $\rho(x)$ at $x_f$ is suspicious - perhaps the problem is that
the prefactor of the $1/\sqrt{|x-x_f|}$ singularity is different on the two
sides of $x_f$. How can a half-singularity at $x=0$ map into both sides of
$x_f$ neighborhood? Presumably the conjugacy (which they do not explain)
should be piecewise analytic, not smooth as in their figures.

Their $g(x)$ is a bad news - they seem to have introduced infinite slope
at an arbitrary point of the map. It's probably an artifact of the
unexplained method for constructing conjugacies - nothing interesting
happens here in the original dynamics. If they can argue that any periodic
orbit that includes critical point has this problem, that is interesting.
Again, the good conjugacy is probably piecewise analytic - the natural
measure they get has worrisome steps.

Here (and in all finite grammar cases they study) working out the
symbolic dynamics and Markov graphs of this map would help - they have to
understand which cycles form the fundamental set and which (families of)
shadowed cycles are causing wild oscillations in their figures, before
embarking on constructing a conjugacy. Original map has no cycles of
infinite instability, so their subsequent troubles presumably come from a
badly chosen conjugacy.

There can no be analytic conjugacy in higher dimensions - measure
singularities always sit on fractal sets, just observe pictures of
natural measure on the H\'enon attractor. Still, if you one find a
conjugacy that excises the neighborhood of the nearly-attracting
13-cycle, that would deal with the main impediment to zeta function
convergence in this case. The method cannot be generalized to higher
dimensions. For private amusement, just try constructing a 2-d conjugacy
for something like a H\'enon map $\to$ Lozi map. Good luck.

There is immense literature on measures of 1-d maps (A. Boyarski? A.
Lasota and M.C. Mackey\rf{LM94}? G. Froyland? E. Bollt? J. M.
Aguirregabiria, Robust chaos with prescribed natural invariant measure
and Lyapunov exponent; \arXiv{0907.3790}? D.J. Driebe, Fully Chaotic Map
and Broken Time Symmetry (Kluwer, 1999)? ... and authors would profit
from using some of that work to illustrate their ideas. They should do a
literature search on measures of 1-d maps. This is reminiscent of work on
natural measures published since 1980's by Hungarian school (Szapfalusy,
Tel, ...), Bollt, and many others.

1-d maps with a single critical point are very special, and unfortunately
little of this is useful in higher dimensions - already for the H\'enon
attractor there is a fractal set of critical points (ie, stable-unstable
manifold tangencies) and their images. No conjugacy or a finite set of
conjugacies can help there...

{\em Chains of rotational tori and filamentary structures close to
  high multiplicity periodic orbits in a 3D galactic potential},

of tori in 4\dmn.
