in. Burak will show you the ropes. You need to register on gitHub, let me
know your user ID there.

\item[2013-10-15  Kamal] I am working on symmetry reduction in spiral waves and have studied a few research papers by Barkley, Biktashev. I am trying to find out how to start working on the problem. In the 1994 paper by Barkley and Kevrekidis {\em A dynamical systems approach to spiral waves dynamics} and another paper by Barkley (Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 1994), they have given an equivalent system of ODE in place of the actual Reaction-Diffusion PDEs. These ODEs also have time shift and $E(2)$ symmetry. Should I apply symmetry reduction on these ODEs or begin with the PDEs?

\item[2013-10-15 Predrag] Our main conceptual confusion (with none of us having
done any actual work so far) is how rotations and translations interact - \ie, if you change the origin and then translate is different from first translating and then rotating. I think you can figure out how that really works in the Barkley ODE system first - that would be a great help. My intuition (usually wrong) is that we want to
quotient the rotational $\SOn{2}$ first.
