\item[2013-10-15  Kamal] I am working on symmetry reduction in spiral waves and have studied a few research papers by Barkley, Biktashev. I am trying to find out how to start working on the problem. In the 1994 paper by Barkley and Kevrekidis "A dynamical systems approach to spiral waves dynamics" and another paper by Barkley (Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 1994), they have given an equivalent system of ODE in place of the actual Reaction-Diffusion PDEs. These ODEs also have time shift and E(2) symmetry. Should I apply symmetry reduction on these ODEs or begin with the PDEs?
