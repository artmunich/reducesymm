just append the newest blog post. Please remove the color from my

Your definition of a \reqv\ is correct for one-parameter $\Group$, but we
will have to rethink it for $N$\dmn\ Lie group $\Group$. In that case the
time trajectory is a 1\dmn\ curve, generically tracing out the $N$\dmn\
group orbit quasiperiodically. Probably a
\HREF{http://www.streamsound.dk/book1/chaos/chaos.html\#205/z} {better
definition} (click on magenta hyperlinks!) would be that
$\vel({\ssp_{\ssp}}) \in \pS_{EQ}$, and than show that this is then true
true anywhere on the group orbit. Perhaps using

derivatives}...

\noindent{\bf Invariant solutions:}                     \toCB
A point $\ssp_{EQ}$ is an \eqv\ if the velocity function evaluated at this
point is 0, namely, $\dot{\ssp}|_{\ssp=\ssp_{EQ}} = \vel({\ssp_{EQ}}) = 0$.
Orbit of
a point $\ssp$ of a $\Group$-equivariant flow is called a \reqv\ if for any
time evolved point on the orbit $\ssp(\tau) = f^{\tau}(\ssp_{REQ})$ there
exists a parameter $\phi$ such that $\ssp(\tau) = \Group(\phi) \ssp$, in other
words, a time orbit is a \reqv\ if it coincides with the group orbit.
 A
point $\ssp$ is on a \po\ if its trajectory passes through itself after some
certain time \period{}, namely $\ssp = f^{\period{}}(\ssp)$. Finally, a point $\ssp$ of a
$\Group$-equivariant flow is said to be on a \rpo\ if there exists a
point $\ssp(\period{}) = f^\period{}(\ssp)$ on the orbit of $\ssp$, such that it satisfies $\ssp(\period{}) =
\LieEl(\phi) \ssp$ for a certain $\phi$.

\noindent{\bf A truncation of PDE representations:}
The {\twoMode} system is the simplest, coarsest example of a truncation
of a Fourier representation of a PDEe. Consider, for example, the $1D$
\KSe.
%
\PC{2013-08-13 Predrag copied this from \refref{SCD07}, to set up
the conventions for the \KSe\ calculations.}
%
The time evolution of the `flame front velocity'
$u=u(x,t)$ on a periodic domain $u(x,t) = u(x+L,t)$ is given by
\beq
  u_t = F(u) = -{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}(u^2)_x-u_{xx}-u_{xxxx}
    \,,\qquad   x \in [-L/2,L/2]
    \,.
\ee{BBks}
Here $t \geq 0$ is the time, and $x$ is the spatial coordinate.
The subscripts $x$ and $t$ denote partial derivatives with respect to
$x$ and $t$. In what follows
we shall state results of all calculations either in units of the
`dimensionless system size' $\tildeL$, or the system size $L = 2 \pi
\tildeL$. All numerical results presented in this report
are for $\tildeL=22/2\pi \simeq 3.5014$.
Spatial periodicity $u(x,t)=u(x+L,t)$
makes it convenient to work in the Fourier space,
\beq
  u(x,t)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} a_k (t) e^{ i k x /\tildeL }
\,,
\ee{BBeq:ksexp}
with the $1$-dimensional PDE \refeq{ks}
replaced by an infinite set of
ODEs for the complex Fourier coefficients $a_k(t)$:
\beq
\dot{a}_k= \pVeloc_k(a)
     = ( q_k^2 - q_k^4 )\, a_k
    - i \frac{q_k}{2} \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} a_m a_{k-m}
\,,
\ee{BBexpan}
where $q_k = k/\tildeL$.
Since $u(x,t)$ is real, $a_k=a_{-k}^\ast$, and we can replace the
sum by a $k > 0$ sum. In the {\twoMode} system we keep only the
$k \in \{\pm 1,pm 2\}$ terms. This is very wrong as an approximation to
the \KSe, but --in the spirit of the Lorentz equations-- OK for hoping
to learn something about the qualitative dynamics of this class of
PDEs.



\subsection{Burak's {\twoMode} blog}
\label{chap:2modesBBblog}

\begin{description}
\item[2012-05-07  Predrag to Chaos Gang] It's not over until it is over.

\item[2013-07-25  Predrag]
 - instead of computing \cLf\ one more
time, how about giving a try to \twoMode\ $\SOn{2}$-equivariant flow,
defined in
\\
\texttt{reducesymm/cgang/2modes.tex}
\\ (you can get it by a click
\HREF{../cgang/2modes.pdf}{here}, provided you had already pdflatex-ed
2modes.tex). Have a look at it, and then meet with Daniel Borrero, 3. floor
Schatz lab, who can walk you through what we had already done and learned
(all in the 2modes.pdf blog). You can play with it for -let's say- two
weeks, see whether you can find an interesting strange attractor worth
slicing. If that does not work out, we'll give up, and go to \KS\ instead,
which is much more important for our overall goals...

\item[2013-08-06 Predrag]
A more precise statement of what we are trying to achieve with this model is
in \emph{reducesymm/cgang/2modes.tex:}

``For the 4\dmn\ model at hand are using the invariant polynomials
$\{u,v,w,q\}$ dynamics only to develop intuition, but to illustrate the
general \mslices, everything has to do be done in $\pS =
\{x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2\}$ and \slice\ $\pSRed$ as well. You can see that even
for the simplest conceivable $\SOn{2}$ 4-dimensional flow one has to
think about how to construct the invariant polynomials basis, and it is
hard to imagine how anyone could do that for very high\dmn\ flows.''

If we can find a nice strange attractor with comparable amplitudes in the
two modes, and show how to slice it, that would be the simplest example of
power of slicing, as the symmetry-reduced dynamics is 3\dmn\ and something
a human can look at, turn around as 3\dmn\ Mathematica or Matlab figure.

If in addition it turns out that my favorite Sobolev norm (read
\texttt{reducesymm/blog/norms.tex}) reduces the number of local slice
hyperplanes needed to cover the attractor, I'll be doubly happy.

%Predrag 2013-08-05 removed ``periodic orbit''
attractive \reqv\  of \twoMode\ flow.}
\label{fig:PKperorb}
\end{figure}

\item[2013-08-05  Burak] I read the \twoMode\ blog and
    \HREF{http://chaosbook.org/paper.shtml\#stability} {Chapter 4} -
    {\em Local stability}, confirmed most of the findings in blog,
    naively experimented on the parameters of the system in $x_i, y_i$
    basis tried to find equilibria, got nothing, then talked to Daniel,
    and re-read the blog and come up with a Monte-Carlo (kind of)
    algorithm hoping that it could get me a strange attractor. So far,
    I only got periodic orbits. \refFig{fig:PKperorb} is a typical one.

\item[2013-08-06 Predrag]
Got worried that there were no updates for 11 days - how about if agree
on a schedule, let's say git pushes
\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,0.00}{every Monday and Friday}?

                                            \toCB
The \po s (actually, \reqva) that you find are presumably \emph{limit
cycles}. In ChaosBook I define `limit cycles' as \po s which are strictly
exponentially attracting forward in time. Parenthetically, in her thesis
De Witte\rf{DWRGK13,DeWitte13} defines a `limit cycle' as an ``isolated
periodic orbit'' thusly:

``A cycle of a continuous-time dynamical system, in a neighbourhood of
which there are no other cycles, is called a limit cycle.''

That presumably has advantage of being true for both directions of time,
but I do not think we need to get that finicky...


\item[2013-08-05  Burak]
    Here is what I did:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Generate pseudo-random set of parameters ensuring $\mu_1 > -\mu_2 > 0$, $c_1 = 1$ and $c_2 = -1$ as suggested in [2012-04-29 Predrag] and [2012-08-06 Edgar Knobloch]
\item
Numerically compute roots of \refeq{PKinvEqs5a} in $u>0, v>0$ region
starting from pseudo-random pair of points $(u,v)$, to find an
equilibrium in invariant polynomial basis.
\bea
\tilde{f}(\tilde{u},\tilde{v}) &=&
  \tilde{u}\,A_1 - \tilde{v}\,A_2 = 0 %Double checked DB 04-30-2012
\,,\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad  deg(f) = 2
\continue
\tilde{g}(\tilde{u},\tilde{v}) &=&  %Double checked DB 04-30-2012
 \left(A_1^2
 - c_1\,\tilde{v}\right)
 \left(\tilde{u}+2\,\tilde{v}\right)^2
 +e_2^2\,\tilde{v}^2 = 0
\,,\qquad  deg(g) = 4
\continue
&& \mbox{where }
A_1 = \mu_1+\tilde{a_1}\,\tilde{u}+\tilde{b_1}\,\tilde{v},
\continue
&& \,\,\,\,\qquad A_2 = \mu_2+\tilde{a_2}\,\tilde{u}+\tilde{b_2}\,\tilde{v}
\,.
\label{PKinvEqs5b}
\eea
\item
Calculate corresponding w and q and check if the syzygy holds (it does).
\item
Calculate eigenvalues of the stability matrix at this point.
\item
If the stability matrix has at least one eigenvalue with positive real part (repulsive), at least one eigenvalue with negative real part (attractive) and a complex pair of eigenvalues with non-zero imaginary part (spiral); keep the parameters and the equilibrium point.
\item
Numerically calculate the points $x_i, y_i$ corresponding to the equilibrium in invariant polynomial basis, using following relations:
\bea
  u &=& x_1^2 + x_2^2\,,
\continue
  v &=& y_1^2 + y_2^2\,,
\continue
  w &=& 2x_1^2y_1+4x_1x_2y_2 - 2x_2^2y_1\,,
\continue
  q &=& 2x_1^2y_2+4x_1x_2y_1 + 2x_2^2y_2\,.
\label{eq:PKinvxirels}
\eea
\item
Integrate the Porter - Knobloch velocity function to see time evolution in
the full \statesp.
\end{itemize}
So far, I got divergent solutions and periodic orbits using parameters that I found this way. My questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item
If I check the eigenvalues of the stability matrix for full \statesp,
I get 3 of the eigenvalues almost same with the ones I get for the
invariant polynomial basis, and one eigenvalue 0 (usually something less
then $10^{-4}$). This gives me the feeling of I am doing things correct,
however, I want to make more sense out of this. Is there a clear
discussion about how these eigenvalues remain unchanged under coordinate
transformations (I saw the discussion about traces in the blog, I
confirmed the result that traces of stability matrices in $u,v,w,q$ basis
and $\pS = \{x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2\}$ basis are not the same at the origin.).
\item
Is what I did reasonable at all? Is there any obvious wrong logic?
\item
Would you suggest any other restrictive criteria to pick a ``good'' set of parameters, in addition to the ones I force on eigenvalues of the stability matrix? I thought, maybe I should take parameters for which the positive and negative real-part eigenvalues are of the same order.
\item
Is an equilibrium in invariant polynomial basis ($u,v,w,q$) a \reqv\ in
the full \statesp\ $\pS = \{x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2\}$ basis? ({\bf [2013-08-13 Predrag]} correct, it is.)
If not, what sense I should make out of the fact
that the relations \refeq{eq:PKinvxirels} do not provide a unique point
$\pS = \{x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2\}$ for given ($u,v,w,q$).
({\bf [2013-08-13 Predrag]} You are on a group orbit in $\pS$, to find
out where requires the full reconstruction equations.)
\end{itemize}
After writing these questions and some more reading, I realized that I did not include anything to eliminate stable limit cycles. I am now starting to read \HREF{http://chaosbook.org/paper.shtml\#invariants} {Chapter 5} - {\em Cycle stability} and then I will try to implement a way of picking equilibria other than attracting limit cycles.

\item[2013-08-06 Predrag]
As we were not successful in finding an interesting strange attractor, probably best
not to be influenced by my (mostly misguided) intuition; keep experimenting, and keep
checking it with Daniel, who remembers what we had tried last time around.
As to our goals, see the ``more precise statement'' above.

My only remark for now is that \reffig{fig:PKperorb} is a \reqv\  of
\twoMode\ flow, meaning that the group orbit and time orbit
coincide, it is not a ``periodic orbit''. If you are \emph{on the \reqv}
you should get one of the full \statesp\ Floquet multipliers equal to 1
to machine precision. The reason is why the Floquet exponent is only
$\approx 10^{-4}$ is that you are converging to the \reqv\ forward in
time, and that is only exponential; once you have Newton codes for
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/paper.shtml\#cycles} {finding \po s} running,
the convergence will be super-exponential.

\item[2013-08-08  Burak] Does \reffig{fig:BBpars3PKflow} look like a
strange attractor? It wanders around a \reqv\ but I'm not
sure if it is a periodic orbit. I tried to slice it but my slicing code
is buggy. I picked a template point on the \reqv\ shown
with red curve on \reffig{fig:BBpars3PKflow}, the result is
\reffig{fig:BBpars3symmred}. \refFig{fig:BBpars3symmred} is a longer run,
and it looks more like a periodic orbit when I run it longer. Is there an
easy way of telling whether it is a periodic orbit or not?

\item[2013-08-13 Predrag]
I do not know what you mean by `\po'. The whole point of this model
is that it has no \po s, only relative invariant solutions, so one
must slice to get any \po s at all?

\item[2013-08-14 Burak] By `\po', I mean an orbit that repeats itself.
\refFig{fig:BBpars3PKflow} is a simulation of \twoMode flow from t = 0 to
100. When I simulated the flow with the same parameters from t=0 to 400 I
got \reffig{fig:BBpars3symmred} and if I run it longer I get a very
similar looking picture. That's what I was guessing that to be a \po.

\item[2013-08-14 Predrag]
There is no `\po' in these figures, in sense of your definitions of
\refsect{chap:2modesBBproj}. I think you found an attractive \rpo\
(attractive torus is the full \statesp) which after symmetry reduction
becomes an attractive \po, AKA a limit cycle. If you plot it in
$\{u,v,w,q\}$, it will be a limit cycle. (Your `Symmetry reduced' frames
in \reffig{fig:BBpars3symmred} look very wrong.)

One way to proceed would be to
change parameters in such a way that this Hopf cycle goes unstable. If it
does it through 2nd Hopf bifurcation, that is a start of a generic
transition to chaos via mode locking and then period doublings.

\item[2013-08-14 Burak]
If you look closely to the upper-left plot in \reffig{fig:BBpars3PKflow},
there is a piece of the blue curve which looks like the red curve
squeezed and turned upside-down ({\bf Predrag} I see it). The starting
point of that simulation corresponds to a point on that piece of the blue
curve. The points on this small piece maps to an \eqv\ in the invariant
polynomials basis, so that's why I was calling that an unstable \reqv\
({\bf Predrag} agreed). After realizing that the actual dynamics (blue
curve) looks like it is making a `wurst' around a group orbit of the
system, I decided to check whether if it is around some \reqv\ of the
system or not. For that reason, I started from other points corresponding
to the relative equilibria of the system, integrated and plotted on top
of the blue curve; one of these curves is the red curve here. Red and
blue curves are time evolutions starting from two different relative
equilibria of the system. While red curve is a stable \reqv, blue curve
starts from an unstable \reqv\ and then starts to rotate and shift around
the stable \reqv\ shown red.

\item[2013-08-08  Burak]
According to my simulations, an attracting \eqv\ in the invariant
polynomials basis corresponds to a stable \reqv\ in the full \statesp.
({\bf [2013-08-13 Predrag]} correct.)
Eliminating these parameter values
gives more interesting dynamics.

\item[2013-08-13 Predrag] \refFig{fig:BBpars3PKflow} does not look like a
strange attractor. You really want to plot these things in $\{u,v,w,q\}$
representation first, and if something looks chaotic, look at it in a
Poincar\'e section; there it is much easier to see whether there is a
stretch \&\ fold unstable manifold with fractal structure.

\item[2013-08-14 Burak] I am going to try to compute Poincar\'e
sections and return maps tomorrow. I have to go back a little bit

Looks right - you are converging to a limit cycle with a negative
least contracting Floquet multiplier. For limit cycles Poincar\'e
sections are boring, they will be useful only one you are looking at
strange attractors.
(I have, experimentally, commented your commit on gitHub, but that
looks useless. Did gitHub alert you to the comment?)
Have you computed Floquet multipliers of this limit cycle? They should
give you the convergence rate exactly.

Now see whether you can pick a convenient parameter that moves one or
a pair of Floquet multipliers through 1 and on to chaos.

As explained in
\HREF{http://www.streamsound.dk/book1/chaos/chaos.html\#78}
{ChaosBook}, 1\dmn\ Poincar\'e return maps, such as of
the radial distance from $w$ axis in \reffig{fig:BBpars4psectnretmap}
are misleading.

\item[2013-08-21]
I got notification for gitHub comment. I tried to calculate the Floquet multipliers but failed really badly at calculating the Jacobian. I thought that I could estimate the Jacobian (in the sense that it is defined in the ChaosBook, not like in Strogatz's book, I think his definition of Jacobian is the Stability Matrix of the ChaosBook) by multiplying the Jacobians for small time steps in a time ordered manner, but result was horrible. I think the numerical errors build up in an intolerable way. Can you refer me some paper/thesis/book that describes the correct way of computing this? I'm assuming that someone did this before and I'd rather not to re-discover it.

\item[2013-08-10  Predrag] I think you should cheat and find chaos
    first in the invariant polynomials basis $\{u,v,w,q\}$ -
    that is already symmetry reduced. After it looks chaotic in the
    invariant polynomials basis, plot the same trajectory in the equivariant
 $\pS = \{x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2\}$ coordinates. That should look messy. After
that construct a \slice\ $\pSRed$.
    \PCedit{
Examples are \reffig{fig:dangelmayrChaos} and \reffig{fig:dangelmayrChaos2}.
    }

That might sound masochistic (why not slice from the start?), but we
are only learning how to slice, and it is easier when you already have a
symmetry-reduced representation. For very high\dmn\ flows we will
not have the luxury of an invariant polynomials basis.

\item[2013-08-12  Burak] I got the parameters that I used in \reffig{fig:BBpars4PKflow} by generating random parameters, discarding if there are attractive equilibria or the time evolution is convergent or divergent in invariant polynomials basis. Unfortunately, this one was a periodic orbit in the invariant polynomials basis.

I added another criteria in my parameter generating code on Saturday to eliminate periodic orbits and discovered a bug in it later today. I spent most of today on varying parameters one by one and trying to see if those variations breaks that periodicity. I didn't get anything interesting yet.

I will run another 'new parameter set finder' tonight with the working periodic orbit elimination.

\item[2013-08-13 Predrag] One way to diagnose chaos  is to pick a stable
solution (like \reffig{fig:PKperorb}) and follow it as it undergoes a
Hopf bifurcation into a stable limit cycle. Then one keeps changing
parameters until this \po\ goes unstable and begets chaos, through period
doublings and beyond. To do this, you need to be able to compute Floquet
multipliers of your invariant solutions. For example, does the unstable
\rpo\ in \reffig{fig:BBpars3PKflow} have complex pair of multipliers
(underwent a Hopf bifurcation that turned it unstable) or two real
multipliers (perhaps on the way to period doubling sequence?)

\item[2013-08-13 Predrag] I have asked a Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
(Woods Hole) Fellow Yuuki Yasuda (Earth and Planetary Science, U. Tokyo,
yyuuki@eps.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp) to learn how to use
\HREF{http://sourceforge.net/projects/auto-07p/} {AUTO}, for the same
reason - to follow bifurcations of initially invariant solutions, see how
they go into chaotic behavior. It is well written code which I think is
only good in small dimensions, so we have not used it for our high\dmn\
hydrodynamics calculations. Yuuki will report to me today how it is
working; I'll report whether it might be useful to you.

\item[2013-08-13 Predrag]
I keep getting confused about whether you are plotting a \reqv\ or a \po,
and as we will need this anyhow, please define \eqv, \reqv, \po, and
\rpo\ in \refsect{chap:2modesBBproj}, just to be sure we are on the same
page. (I keep using macros for their names, because depending on the
publication and audience, a `\reqv' might be called a `rotating wave',
etc.)

\item[2013-08-13 Predrag]
A problem with {\twoMode} system is too many parameters (seven! - see
\refeq{PKinvEqs5b}). How about reducing the number of parameters by
demanding that our {\twoMode} system is the $k \in \{\pm 1,\pm 2\}$
truncation of \KS? There is only one parameter left (the system size
$L$), so that is probably too radical -- maybe it will
yield no interesting dynamics at all,
but let something physical like this guide you in reducing the number of
parameters.

The physical setting is that a dissipative turbulent system has a finite
number of Fourier modes nonlinearly coupled and of comparable amplitudes,
while high modes are very strongly suppressed by dissipative terms like
$q_k^4$ in \refeq{BBexpan}. (Xiong Ding can explain the `physical
dimension' to you). So you will be interested in chaotic solutions for
which the two modes $u = {z}_1 \overline{z}_1,\, v = {z}_2
\overline{z}_2$ in \refeq{PKinvEqs1} are of comparable magnitude.

One good exercise is to go through Ruslan's {\em 15.7.1 2009-08-26
Epicycles: 2-Fourier modes} in the \HREF{../blog/blog.pdf} {main blog}.
In this model he looks at a trivial dynamics of two uncoupled modes. I do
not agree with Ruslan pessimistic conclusion - search for `epicycles'
within the blog for more optimistic angles.

\item[2013-08-21 Burak] I varied the parameters I used in \reffig{fig:BBpars4invspacePKflow} and \reffig{fig:BBpars4psectnretmap} and
the \fixedpnt\ in the Poincar\'e section (attracting limit cycle in the flow) got bifurcated to a two cycle. After playing a little bit more, I got \reffig{fig:BBinvspacePKflow130821}. In \reffig{fig:BBinvspacePKflow130821}, every trajectory goes near the origin, make a small turn there and start go away and make another turn at a different location far away from the origin and go back. This behavior is better seen in the Poincar\'e return map on the right hand side of \reffig{fig:BBpsectandretmap130821}. On the return map, different points with larger radial distances are mapped to the neighborhood of the radius 5, and points with radii close to 5 are mapped to different points (without following a regular pattern.). This, I think, satisfies the `extreme dependence on initial state' condition of chaos.

After liking what I saw in the invariant polynomials basis, I went ahead and integrated the system in the full state space and try to \slice\ it using method of moving frames.

I tried a few template points (I tried to find \eqva\ and use them, didn't look good at all) and got the prettiest picture with the template $\slicep = (1,1,0,0)$.

\item[2013-08-22 Predrag] This looks promising. Comparing
\reffig{fig:BBinvspacePKflow130821}
and
\reffig{fig:BBsymmredflow130821}
you can see one of the reasons why I do not like symmetry reduction by
slices to invariant polynomials basis, even in a few dimensions, where
syzygies are few: invariant polynomials scrunch everything into the
origin. If you and Daniel settle on this one as an example (I would
prefer an example where you need at least two slice hyper-planes -
presumably when the two modes are of comparable strength; and when
some parameters are eliminated by requiring that the \twoMode\ system
is close to the \KS\ 2-mode truncation), than you should do
Poincar\'e sections more carefully, using points ant not '*',
constructing the unstable manifolds by continuing the Floquet vectors
of the initial (now unstable) Hopf cycle, and constructing the return
map from them, as discussed in
\HREF{http://www.streamsound.dk/book1/chaos/chaos.html\#260/z}
{Chapter 12} {\em Stretch, fold, prune}.

\item[2013-08-21 Daniel] Ok... so while you guys are off doing all the thinking, I brute forced a set of parameters that appear to give chaotic dynamics. Basically, I used the same Monte Carlo-ish technique that I used to find ``good'' templates for slicing \CLf where I let the computer vary parameters by a little bit and see if they give better results. If so they are used a new starting point and the calculation is repeated; if not they are discarded. To measure ``success'' I calculated finite time Lyapunov exponents for the \twoMode\ system in the invariant polynomials basis and required that the leading one be positive (the more positive the better), the second one be zero (guaranteed by autonomous dynamics), and the third one be negative (the more negative the better). The algorithm prints them out in order, so the fourth one is automatically more negative than the third. The code I used is in \texttt{/cgang/Daniel/Matlab/ChaoticExponentsCalculation} and should have enough comments for intelligibility. The algorithm used is based on Wolf et al. \cite{WolfSwift85}. I let the computer run this for a day or so and got the following set of parameters:
\bea
\mu_1&=&-2.8023, \mu_2=0.6128, a_1=-0.9146, a_2=-2.6636
    \continue
b_1  &=& -0.6141, b_2=-0.0144, c_1=-4.1122, c_2=1.8854, e_2=2.1769

\item[2013-08-23 Predrag to Daniel]
Got your rotatable Matlab file  - it was probably OK yesterday, I just did something wrong then....

It's both a boring looking attractor (this is is really in a single slice hyperplane coordinates; not the invariant polynomials basis?), and a little bit too singular - maybe two charts needed?
    } 

\DBedit{\item[2012-08-25 Daniel to Predrag] I might have had the axis labels wrong in the Matlab fig that I sent you. Basically in invariant coordinates it looks like \reffig{fig:PKChaoticInv} and in Cartesian coordinates it looks like \reffig{fig:PKChaotic}.}

\item[2013-08-21 Daniel]
Calculating the Lyapunov exponents for the \twoMode\ system gives
\begin{equation}
\lambda_1=0.09, \lambda_2=0.00, \lambda_3=-9.14,\, \mathrm{ and }\, \lambda_4=-17.77.
\label{eq:PKLyapunovExp}
\end{equation}

\item[2013-08-23 Predrag to Daniel]
are these the
\HREF{http://www.streamsound.dk/book1/chaos/chaos.html\#137/z}
{Lyapunov} exponents, or the real parts of stability exponents?
    \PCedit{
I guess it is
Lyapunov exponents. Ask Xiong to compute stability exponents for
this system - while finite time stability and Lyapunov exponents
differ, I do not know whether they really converge to each other for
long times. You are really able to compute
$ \lambda_4=-17.77$ to even one digit, let alone 4 digits?
    }

\DBedit{\item[2013-08-25 Daniel to Predrag] Well Wolf and co. \cite{WolfSwift85} call them Lyapunov exponents in the paper where the algorithm that I used is described. I don't know that I would necesarilly trust the -17.77 to any precision but it is what the code spits out. It does spit out the REALLY negative Lyapunov exponent for the Lorenz system (-22.46) that is reported in the literature \refrefs{WolfSwift85,Briggs1990}, as well as the -9.77  that is reported for R\"ossler to within 0.1, so while maybe I wouldn't swear that the fractional part is correct, I think the -17 is probably real.}

\item[2013-08-21 Daniel]
Coincidentally, the first three are almost exactly the Lyapunov
exponents for the R\"ossler system ($\lambda_1=0.09,
\lambda_2=0.00,\, \mathrm{and}\, \lambda_3=-9.77$).
\refFig{fig:PKChaoticInv} shows what it ends up looking like in the
invariant polynomials basis. If you run it longer it just fills out
the attractor. \refFig{fig:PKChaotic} shows it in the full
\statesp. If you run it longer it just fills out the attractor.

\item[2013-08-23 Burak] I integrated the system with Daniel's parameters and my simulation converged to \eqv\ $(0,425.56,0,0)$ in the invariant polynomials basis (see \reffig{fig:BBPKflowDanielPars}\,(a)). I found all eigenvalues of the stability matrix at this point to be negative with zero imaginary parts. As I expected, this resulted in a \reqv\ in the full state space (see \reffig{fig:BBPKflowDanielPars}\,(b)).

I also sliced this solution with the same template that I used for my
parameters and got \reffig{fig:BBsymmredPKDanielPars0t12} for the
time that the solution looked chaotic (t from 0 to 12), it then makes
a jump (see \reffig{fig:BBsymmredPKDanielPars14t20} (a) for evolution
from t=14 to t=17) as the solution in invariant polynomials basis
does, and then converges to the \reqv\ (see
\reffig{fig:BBsymmredPKDanielPars14t20} (b) for evolution from t=15.5
to t=20) by going through a spiral.
    \PC{what figure does  fig:BBsymmredPKDanielPars14t20 refer to?
    If it was erroneous, rewrite this post; also all other figures
    that have turned to ?'s now. Whenever you comment out / remove / rename
     a labeled environment,
    search for the commented-out label and fix all references to it.}
I'm blogging this because I found
it interesting to see a ``spiral in'' type of convergence on the
symmetry reduced manifold while all eigenvalues of the stability
matrix of the \eqv\ in the invariant space have zero imaginary
parts.

\item[2013-08-23 Predrag] Having \eqv\ at $(0,425.56,0,0)$ in the
invariant polynomials basis must mean that it sits in an invariant
subspace (there is much discussion of a such subspace earlier in the
blog, check whether it is in this subspace). Then it will have
eigenvectors within the subspace, and others that point out - all of
that should be significant. `Spiral in' I find unexpected, maybe
there is an unstable \eqv\ you are missing?

\item[2013-08-23 Burak]
The inconsistent look of the equilibria was due to a numerical error.
I used different time steps for simulations in invariant basis
($\Delta t = 0.001$) and full state space ($\Delta t = 0.01$). When I
checked in the invariant polynomials basis, I found that when I use
the smaller time step, simulation converges to a \reqv\
(zero velocity) but if I use the bigger time step, it ends up in a
\po. I calculated the final point of the full state space
simulation and found a point corresponding to the cycle in the
invariant polynomial space.
\PCedit{({\bf [2013-08-24 Predrag]} Do you mean: ``I calculated the
\reqv\ in the full \statesp\ and found the corresponding \eqv\  in
the invariant polynomials basis''?)}
My point is, there is no direct correspondence between the invariant
polynomials basis plot that I posted (\reffig{fig:BBPKflowDanielPars}
(a)) and full \statesp\ plot (\reffig{fig:BBPKflowDanielPars} (b)).
Since symmetry reduction plots are generated from the full \statesp\
data, they are also not so accurate. I am now simulating the full
\statesp\ with higher resolution, I already found that the full
\statesp\ system converges to an \reqv\ in the $(y_1,y_2)$ plane and
$x_1 = x_2 = 0$ all the time. This is expected from the
transformation relations \refeq{eq:PKinvxirels} and all points on
this \reqv\ are mapped to the invariant polynomials basis \eqv\
$(0,425.56,0,0)$. Sliced results will be ready tomorrow morning.

Basically, you have to keep checking whether your trajectory has
crossed the border of your single slice hyperplane. If so, two-hyperplane (with a ridge
in-between) cover of the slice is needed.

\item[2013-08-23 Daniel] Just ran a couple of hundred simulations
using the parameters from \refeq{eq:PKChaoticParams} with random
initial conditions taken from a Gaussian ball centered at
$(u,v,w,q)\, =\,(0,0,0,0)$ with radius of about 8. Each simulation
was run for 1\,000 time units. I found that the trajectories ended up
at Burak's \eqv\ about 70\% of the time, so it's basin of attraction
is definitely significant. Then again, 30\% of trajectories fall into
the chaotic attractor and stay there for long times, so it's basin of
attraction is not tiny either. It also doesn't seem like the chaotic
dynamics are transient. I can integrate out to 20\,000 time units and
still be in the attractor if I start in its basin of attraction
(e.g., $(u,v,w,q)\, =\,(1,1,1,1)$ . Maybe we can tweak the parameters
to make Burak's \eqv\ unstable or hyperbolic? Looking at the
symbolic expressions for the eigenvalues, I don't see a particularly
obvious way to do this. The expressions are a mess!

\item[2013-08-23 Predrag] I do not mind coexisting attractors - that's what we have
for the pipe and the \pCf s anyway.

\item[2013-08-23 Burak] I tried to calculate the dynamics within the slice and then reconstruct today. It worked perfectly on 1 slice for Daniel's parameters. I am commiting the Matlab (Octave) functions and scripts that I used at
\texttt{/blog/burak/PorterKnobloch}
If you want to test them, first run \texttt{generator.m}, this will generate generator.mat with the group generator matrix in it. You can then integrate the system by running \texttt{PKintegrate.m} and then you can reduce the symmetry by running \texttt{PKComputeMovingFrames.m} and you can do everything starting from the reduced space by running \texttt{PKComputeDynamicsWithinSlice.m}. Now to compare the results from both approaches you can run \texttt{PKPlotDynamicsWithinSlice.m}. You should see exactly the same dynamics on the slice and in the full state space calculated with different techniques. I am not posting these results but basically I get the exact same plot with \reffig{fig:BBsymmredPKDanielPars0t12} by calculating the dynamics entirely on the slice.

I was not this lucky with my parameters. When I tried to simulate the dynamics on the slice with the same initial point, I got something that started similar to the slice from the moving frames, and then settled on a limit cycle, results of two methods are side by side on \reffig{fig:BBreduceddynamicstwomethods} for comparison. I also plotted the variation of the group parameters, $\phi(t)$ (computed within the slice) and $\phi(\tau)$ computed using moving frames, and the square of the Euclidian norm of the difference between state vectors, $|x_r(t)-x(t)|^2$, calculated both by reconstruction from the slice and the direct integration in the full \statesp\ (\reffig{fig:BBreductionmethodsdiff}). Any ideas why is this the case?

\item[2013-08-24 Burak] For amusement, I rotated the symmetry reduced dynamics such that one of the coordinates was always 0 hence got the entire dynamics confined in 3 dimensions so that we can see it without any projections. I used Daniel's parameters to produce \reffig{fig:BBPKreducedto3d}. You can use \texttt{PKPlotMovingFrames.m} after computing the moving frames by following the steps in [2013-08-23 Burak] to produce this plot.

\DBedit{\item[2013-08-25 Daniel] There is actually a less contrived way to look at the dynamics in 3D. Just write down $(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2)$ as $(r_1\cos{\theta_1},r_1\sin{\theta_1},r_2\cos{\theta_2},r_2\sin{\theta_2})$. Then the equations of motion reduce to $(r_1,r_2,\theta)$ where $\theta=2\theta_1 - \theta_2$.

sounds like my ChaosBook chapter
written many years ago, and that I have to rewrite from scratch,
almost... Things have advanced since. Can you guys use the notation
of the c-gang paper\rf{atlas12}? It's not a `rotated frame' but a
slice hyperplane, and that is defined by writing down the group
tangent vector \sliceTan\ evaluated at the template \slicep. That is
almost never a hyperplane corresponding to setting a full \statesp\
coordinate to zero, the flow is nonlinear, and a good template is
intrinsic to the flow, not to the coordinate system used.

\item[2013-08-24 Predrag] Sorry, at the first parsing, I have no
interpretation of \reffig{fig:BBPKreducedto3d}. Daniel - can you have
the first go?


\item[2013-08-24 Burak] I varied Daniel's parameters a little bit and I think found a better behaving set. I computed the trace of the stability matrix at the \eqv\ and tried to make it less negative. To do that, I varied $b_1$ and got better looking flows for $b_1 \rightarrow b_1 / n$. \reffig{fig:BBdanielvariedflow} shows the flow in the invariant basis and the \reffig{fig:BBdanielvariedpoincare} is the corresponding Poincar\'e section for the parameter set given in \refeq{eq:PKDanielParsVaried}. Some fine tuning on $b_1$ may give a better chaotic attractor but I have to leave soon so I am blogging prematurely. There might also be a bug in my Poincar\'e section code because numbers does not make sense to me but I believe the picture is qualitatively correct.

\item[2013-08-24 Predrag to Daniel] Looks like this might result in a
publication. At what point do you think we should invite the original
cgang contributors, offer them a chance to join this? In my case, I
believe that a co-authorship should require a substantial
contribution, minor ones go into the acknowledgments.

\DBedit{\item[2013-08-25 Daniel to Predrag] Well, I think only Keith expressed interest originally. Anyway, I think if we are going to get them involved with this, it might as well be sooner rather than later so that they can make a significant contribution (and don't have too much to catch up on, which might disincentivize them to actually do anything).}

\item[2013-08-24 Predrag]
The general drift if where you are going looks promising. Remember,
you always must check whether the single slice hyperplane reduced
dynamics crosses the chart border. If it does, pick a 2. template
(that captures dynamics that lies beyond), and check that dynamics
crosses the two-slice hyper-planes ridge before it hits the chart
border. And so on. Looking forward to drawing the 3-slabs drawing for
the 3 slices case.

To make sure you understand this (Daniel does), email now appointment
time to Ashley ashleypwillis@gmail.com and Kimberley for Monday, and
