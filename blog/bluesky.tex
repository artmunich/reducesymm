\subsection{Heteroclinic connections literature}

Do literature review of algorithms to
compute heteroclinic connections.

Are ``Robust Heteroclinic Cycles" relevant to our heteroclinic connections?

\subsection{Find nontrivial stable coherent state}

ChaosBook.org shows that a perturbed H\'enon falls into 13-cycle.
Lan and Cvitanovi{\'c}\rf{lanCvit07} show that ``turbulent" KS has an
unexpected, not trivial {\em stable} \eqv.

Find such by slightly varying cell size,
to cure community from believing that
the laminar state is the only stable attractor.
