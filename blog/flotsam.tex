{\bf PC}: believe it or not, we are now set to compute
    $\timeAver{E}$ and $\timeAver{P}$
    using cycle expansions


Substitution by \refeq{KSeqvCond}
verifies that for an \eqv\ $\expctE$ is constant:
\[
   \dot{\expctE} =
\expct{ \left({u^2}/{2} + u_{x} + u_{xxx} \right) u_x}
    = \expctE \expct{ u_x }=0
    \,.
\]


% PC worked out in part with Bridges
An infinite number of identities for moments of
solutions of KS follow\rf{Bridges_priv}. For example,
integrating by parts $\expct{u_{x} u_t}$,
$\expct{u_{xx} u_t}$,
and
$\expct{u^2 u_t}$,
respectively, one obtains \reqva\ relations
\PC{please re-derive these three. Are there more
    important ones that I have missed?
    Also, I - unnecessarily - specialized to \reqva,
    but these identities will be especially useful for \rpo s}
\RLD{I don't quite follow this process of deriving moments.  What is
the reason we look for some combinations of $u$ and its derivatives?
Why not just take $\expct{u_{x\cdots x}}$?
Is there any physical motivation for such combinations,
beyond $E$, $P$ and $D$?  Maybe use things like $\dot{P}$,
$\dot{D}$, etc.?}
\PC{they merit more thought and time than we have now, so let's
   pick them up after the first paper is submitted}
\bea
% \expct{u_{x} u_t}
%     \qquad \to \qquad
c P &=& \expct{u \, u_{x}{}^2}
\label{Bridges1}\\
c P  &=& \expct{u \, u_{xx}{}^2}
\label{Bridges3}
\,.
\eea
True for any solution:
\bea
% \expct{u_{xx} u_t}
%     \qquad \to \qquad
\dot{P} &=& 2P - \expct{u_{x}{}^3}  - 2 \expct{u_{xxx}{}^2}
\label{PC1}\\
\dot{D} &=& 2\expct{u_{xxxx}{}^2}
    + 5 \expct{u_{xx}{}^2 u_{x}}  - 2 \expct{u_{xxx}{}^2}
\label{PC2} \\
\dot{P} &=& 2P - \expct{u_{x}{}^3}  - 2 \expct{u_{xxx}{}^2}
\label{PC3}\\
\frac{d^2 E}{dt^2} &=& \dot{P} - \dot{D} =
     2P - \expct{u_{x}{}^3}
    - 2\expct{u_{xxxx}{}^2} - 5 \expct{u_{xx}{}^2 u_{x}}
\label{PC4}\\
\frac{d}{dt} \expct{u_{x}{}^3} &=&
        3 \expct{u_{x}{}^3u + u_{xx}{}^3}
\label{PC5}
\,.
\eea
When moments such as \refeq{Bridges1} are added as
coordinate axes to reffig~{f:drivedragConn}, \reqva\ and
\rpo s are separated from \eqva\ and \po s. Furthermore,
as higher moments have more and more powers of $u$ and derivatives
$u_{xx\cdots x}$, their magnitudes should be strongly suppressed,
providing a symmetry-invariant basis set that can be safely truncated to
a finite-dimensional \statesp.
See  refsect~{sec:energyL22} for how this works out in practice.

 It is the unstable manifold of the \EQV{2}
{\eqv}, drawn by tracing out a set of points along one of the complex
eigenvectors, that start close to it. Surprisingly, everybody connects
to the \EQV{2} shifts by 1/2 wavelength ($d = L/4$) but as we are in
$\infty$-dimensions they do it not as the usual homoclinic connection, but in
many (all?) possible intermediate ways. This might be a clue for how to
partition symbolic dynamics.
What is great about
this is that the \EQV{2} unstable manifold has a heteroclinic connection to itself
$L/2$ shifted, but
even better, to \EQV{2}, and \EQV{3} unstable manifold has a heteroclinic
connection to \EQV{2}.
% It's really pretty.
That makes for a rigid backbone -
we hope this will help us develop a symbolic dynamics for \rpo s.

The KS work
% described in refsect~{s:KS}
of \refref{Christiansen97} was restricted to the
antisymmetric subspace. The restriction to antisymmetric
subspace was used to eliminate the continuous translational
symmetry of \KSe. The antisymmetric subspace is unstable
under small perturbations, and generic solutions of KS belong
to the full, periodic space. Nevertheless, the \eqva\ and the
shortest \po s orbits that lie in this subspace and play
important role for global topology of the flow, together with
the \reqva\ and \rpo s characteristic of the full, continuous
translation invariant space.

As a result, KS can have
%\reqva\ (traveling wave) solutions $u(x-ct)$ and
\rpo\ $p$ with period $\period{p}$ and
a nonzero shift $\shift_p$
\beq
%\tau_p \Refl_p u_p(x,0) =
\sigma_p u_p(\sigma_p x+\shift_p,\period{p}) = u_p(x,0)
\,,\qquad
\sigma_p \in \{+1,-1\}
\,,
\ee{KSrposFlot}
\ie, a state $u_p(x,0)$ that occurs again after time $\period{p}$,
but shifted by $\shift_p$, and possibly reflected by $\Refl$.
{\Rpo s} are periodic in $c=\shift_p/\period{p}$
co-rotating frame,
but in the stationary frame their trajectories
are quasiperiodic.
Due to the reflection symmetry \refeq{KSparity} of KS equation,
every \rpo\
$u_p(x,t)$ with shift $\shift_p$ has a symmetric partner
$-u_p(-x,t)$ with shift $-\shift_p$.

    Eckmann had $L^{8/5}$, but conceptually Otto is the best. Recheck whether it is

    When the solution is big, how long can it stay big? They found it cannot stay big for

from bounds on energy, we might be able
to bound the number of \eqva\ as function of systems size $L$, and thus
be sure we have them all.

Next for you guys: read Lieb and Ruelle to learn
    how to bound $E$  by Sobolev bounds.

{\bf PC} March 2009:
if you really believe that --let's say- B. Hof's pipe is an example of ``chaos,'' more
    power to you. But please do include our referee's precise definitions of
    chaos, spatio-temporal chaos and turbulence in the thesis.

{\bf ES} March 2009: No, I don't consider Hof's pipe to be ``chaos'',
		but do we have a better, widely accepted word
		that describes this Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system? I anyway
		find the definition of ``spatio-temporal chaos'' suggested
		by the referee vague. To me it looks more that it is an issue
		of broken symmetry in \KS\ rather than system size,
		at least that's what I get when I read Manneville's book.
		What I was really trying to
		say is that we call it turbulence because it is not
		what people refer to as chaos. I've dropped both chaotic
		and spatiotemporally chaotic.


{\bf ES} March 2009:
There exist two methods to convert a non-free\ES{but
effective} action of a group $\Group$ on a manifold $\Manif$
to a free action: one either prolongs the action to jet space
and thus calculates differential invariants, or considers the
action of the group in $n$ copies of $\Manif$ with $n>>0$ and
thus calculates joint invariants, see \refref{Olver2000} for
applications. The second method will not be helpful for us
since the dimension of the manifolds that we are interested
in is already very high. We have not found a way to implement
the method of prolongation efficiently for the problems
considered here. The way to get around non-free actions will
be explained in refsect~{laserMFnum}.


{\bf ES} March 2009:
The Gr\"{o}bner basis methods usually perform poorly as $n$
becomes larger than six. On a 1GHz Pentium III processor the
fundamental invariants for $n=16$, for the cross section
$b_1=0$, were computed in approximately 130s. Most
importantly the time was mostly spend in simplification of
expressions. If one only wants to project equivariant
dynamics on the \reducedsp\ then the moving frame method,
through its geometric interpretation, can be used to perform
the projection without explicit knowledge of the fundamental
invariants.

{\bf PC} 10 Apr 2008:
    This received wisdom that heteroclinic connections
    are due to continuous symmetries is nonsense. You have a
    heteroclinic connection in Lorentz, right? They can be
    robust if dimension of unstable manifold A + codimension
    of the stable manifold B add to or exceed the dimension
    of the \statesp, as explained in \refref{GHCV08}.

% \subsection*{Proximity of chaotic attractor to \eqva\ and \reqva}
% \label{sec:proxeq}

In order to illustrate the relative influence of \eqva\ and \reqva\ on the dynamics
within the KS chaotic attractor for $L = 22$, we calculated the distance of a
typical orbit, shown in refFig~{f:ks\_L22}, to different \eqva\ and \reqva .

The distance of a state-space point $a$ to \eqv\ $a_{\EQV{k}}$ is measured as a
Euclidean distance in Fourier space minimized with respect to the translation
of the \eqv\ by $\Shift_{\shift/L}$:
\beq
  d_{\EQV{k}} = \min_\shift \|a - \Shift_{\shift/L} a_{\EQV{k}} \|\,,\quad k = 1,2,3.
\ee{eq:proxeq}
Similarly, the distance to \reqv\ $a_{\REQV{\pm}{k}}$ is defined as follows
\beq
  d_{\REQV{k}{}} = \min_{\shift} \|a - \Shift_{\shift/L} a_{\REQV{\pm}{k}} \|\,,\quad k = 1,2,
\ee{eq:proxtw}
where we consider the distance to both $a_{\REQV{-}{k}}$ and $a_{\REQV{+}{k}}$, thus
minimizing both with respect to translation $\Shift_{\shift/L}$ and reflection $\Refl$.

The plot of $d_{\EQV{k}}$ in refFig~{f:ks\_prox\_eq}(b) show that \EQV{2} has a dominant
influence on the dynamics, \EQV{3} is influencing the dynamics more intermittently, while
\EQV{1} has little effect on the dynamics.  Similarly, as shown in refFig~{f:ks\_prox\_eq}(c),
the chaotic orbit does not visit the neighborhoods of \reqva , so their influence on
the chaotic dynamics is also minimal.

The horizontal line at $0.048$

} \label{f:ks22rposT}
\end{figure}

refFig~{f:ks22rposT}\,(\textit{a}) shows the \rpo s in the plane
$(\period{},\shift)$.  Not much is learned from such plot other than
that for longer periods the \rpo s are scattered over the
whole $(\period{},\shift)$ plane.

The scatter of the largest Floquet exponents
of periodic and \rpo s is shown in reffig~{f:ks22rposT}\,(\textit{b}).
In this case some tendency of accumulation toward the largest
Lyapunov exponent 0.048 of the chaotic attractor
can be noted.  This, however, is in part an artifact of initializing
the \rpo\ searches by near recurrences in long-time \statesp\
trajectories.

ES:{I observe pairs of real eigenvalues,
e.g. -58.3602685 and -58.3602681. As their absolute
value increases they differ even less.
I think it has to do with the linear part being the main
contribution to $\Mvar$ for higher modes, as well as
with treating real and imaginary components
as separate variables, which means it will appear twice.
        }

PC: {I think such contracting eigenvalues as -58.3602685 have no meaning.
Even if they are accurate eigenvalues of $\Mvar$,
what use is
$\ExpaEig_{radial} =  e^{\Lyap_p \period{p}} = e^{26\cdot58} = e^{1510}$.
        }

The \reqva\ (or traveling waves) appear to have a limiting propagation
velocity $c_{max} = \pm d/\period{}$.
To visualize them numerically,
start with a localized self-dual $u(x,0)$ such as
\[
u(x,0) = x e^{- x^2/2\sigma^2}
\,,
\]
with typical width $\sigma/2$ of order of typical wavelength
$\sqrt{2}$ (in $\tilde{L}$ system size units).
Time evolution of this  $u(x,t)$ is bracketed by two constant
pulses of apparently constant velocity $v=?$.

Staring at the solution
 as it evolves in time we should start getting a glimpse of the
 repertoire of the spatiotemporal patterns characterizing
 the turbulent dynamics.

Many of the \rpo s can be constructed from segments corresponding to
close approaches to some of these \eqva.

\textbf{ES}: Greene and Kim show that steady states (non-traveling)
have to be antisymmetric and our findings verify it.

\textbf{PC}: do they really show that? I think they must be symmetric under both
{\Refl} and \Shift, otherwise they could be invariant under one,
but traveling, not invariant under the other one.

\textbf{ES}: They provide an argument for this which did not yet convinced me.
\EQV{2,3} are symmetric under both {\Refl} and \Shift, \EQV{1} is not
symmetric under \Shift, but when I say traveling I mean traveling waves,
this does not refer to behavior under symmetry.

If Greene and Kim
are correct we would get the same \eqva\ for both
antisymmetric and full space. If \eqva\ provide the coarsest organization
of \statesp\ then we should expect characteristic orbits for $L=22.0$
for full space and $L=44.0$ for antisymmetric subspace to be completely different.
Of course for $L=22.0$ the full space dynamics will be richer than
in the
antisymmetric subspace, but I don't think this can be quantified by
dividing $\tildeL$ by $2$.

\textbf{PC}: you are right.


\subsection{Numerical methods}

Shroff and Keller\rf{shroff:1099}
``The Recursive Projection Method" (RPM)
might be of interest to us in numerical work.
RPM stabilizes fixed-point iterative
procedures by computing a projection onto the unstable subspace.
On this subspace a Newton or special Newton iteration is performed,
and the fixed-point iteration is used on the complement.
The method is effective when the dimension of the unstable subspace
is small compared to the dimension of the system.
Examples are presented for computing unstable steady states.
The RPM can also be used to accelerate iterative procedures when
slow convergence is due to a few slowly decaying modes.

PC also has 2 hard-copy, rather readable
old proceedings reprints by Keller\rf{Keller77,Keller79}.
There are some readable words about homotopy methods in
\refref{AllgGeorg88}.


%% Davidchack and Crofts
 We investigate this system in 16 to 64 complex Fourier modes (32 to
128-dimensional system of real ODEs) truncation, and recheck the results
by redoing the calculation with the double number of Fourier modes. %
observe how many digits change. The \eqv\ points are accurate to at least
to $10^{-11}$. Since Lapack is also double precision accurate, the
accuracy of the first few eigenvalues is similar, and certainly in excess
of 6 significant digits. % All digits stated in tables are significant.
The accuracy that can be reached is of order of
$|a(\period{p},d_p) - a_0|
 \approx \epsilon \exp(\Lyap_p \period{p})$,
 where $\epsilon \approx 10^{-17}$ for double precision, $\Lyap_p$ is
the largest Lyapunov exponent, and $\period{p}$ the period.  With a good
starting guess, Newton's method typically reaches that accuracy after 2-3
iterates.

expensive. We demonstrate that this problem can be locally
reduced to solving a system of quasi-linear PDEs, which can be
efficiently solved in an Eulerian framework. We construct a
fast numerical method for solving the resulting system of
discretized nonlinear equations. The efficiency stems from
decoupling the system and ordering the computations to take
advantage of the direction of information flow. We illustrate
our approach by constructing two-dimensional invariant
manifolds of hyperbolic \eqva\ in $R^3$ and $R^4$."

\subsection{{\Rpo s} of the complex Ginzburg-Landau}

\noindent{\bf V. Lopez:
        {\Rpo s} of the Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equation}
As far as the discussion about ``drift" is concerned:
In presence of continuous symmetries (for PC, streamwise and
spanwise translations) one should be searching for
{\reqva} and
{\rpo s} - they are most likely more important than
the \eqva\ and spatially periodic orbits.

I like {\rpo s} paper\rf{lop05rel} by
Vanessa L{\'o}pez %\rf{lopezLink},
%        http://www.cse.uiuc.edu/$\sim$vlopez:
``Relative Periodic Solutions of the Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equation"

% [From siads\@siam.org  Dec 22 2004]:
% willing to review this manuscript for Dwight Barkley.

A method of finding {\rpo s} for differential equations with
continuous symmetries is described and its utility demonstrated by computing
{\rpo s} for the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau
equation (CGLE) with periodic boundary conditions.  A {\rpo} is
a solution that is periodic in time, up to a transformation by an element of the
equation's symmetry group.  With the method used, {\rpo s} are
represented by a space-time Fourier series modified to include the symmetry
group element and are sought as solutions to a system of nonlinear algebraic
equations for the Fourier coefficients, group element, and time period.
{\Rpo s} found for the CGLE exhibit a wide variety of temporal
dynamics,
with the % sum of their positive Lyapunov exponents varying from 5.19 to
% 60.35 and their
unstable dimensions from 3 to 8.

15 Sep 2004, Predrag Cvitanovic:
All of your {\Rpo s} have many unstable
eigendirections. Do you know that there exist no other solutions with a
lesser number of unstable directions (let's say only one)?

--vanessa:
I do not know of any proof that shows that there are no solutions with a
lesser number of unstable directions.  I did not find any solutions with
just one or two unstable directions, but at this point I cannot say
whether that is an indication that there are none or simply that
the procedure I used only identified solutions with 3+ unstable
directions.

15 Sep 2004, Predrag Cvitanovic:
Periodic solutions are usefull if they are embedded into a chaotic
attractor. Do you have any measure of whether the typical solutions of
CGL, your parameter values, come close to any of the solutions that you
have found? If the periodic orbit is embedded into a chaotic attractor,
typical soultion visits it infinitely often, infinitesimally close.

--vanessa:
This is something that I have not examined in detail.  I have observed (using
the ``naked eye") that the time evolution of typical trajectories (when viewed
by plotting the real versus imaginary part of A(x,t) at different times, as in
Figures 3,5,7 from the paper) sometimes resembles that of the first solution
found (i.e., the patterns displayed in Figure 3). (The first solution
found also happened to be the solution to which the solver I used
converged to most frequently.)  But I do not have a
quantitative measure of this ``resemblance".

After talking to Lopez at SIAM DS05 meeting: I do not think
her \rpo s are the dynamically important ones, so the problem remains wide open.

I read through
Vanessa L{\'o}pez's paper (clearly a summary of a PhD thesis), and while I
a like {\rpo s}, I am very worried about the general drift
of the paper.

As I cannot tell how exhaustive is her set of numerical solutions, I do
not know what to make of them - like ZG, she gets all of them with a large
number unstable dimensions. Presumably none of them are close to the
asymptotic inertial manifold. More worrisome still, she uses ZG to
``average" over periodic orbits. That is regrettable - I hoped I would
never see that stuff again. Dettmann and I tried to get Zoldi to
derive this for us, and Mainieri actually hired him at Los Alamos to learn
how this works. We are all convinced that it makes no sense whatsoever.
Regrettably Lopez used the nonsensical formulas of Zoldy, so that will
just keep confusing future readers.
She is in computer science, so cannot
blame a graduate student for trying a formula published in Phys Rev Lett.

        Here we discuss these continuous symmetries as
a small-step limit of discrete symmetries:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
        symmetries of 3-disk
\item
        $C_n$ symmetry of $n$-slice pizza without reflection symmetry
\item
        Fourier analysis of periodic lattices
\item
        running modes in periodic lattice deterministic
           diffusion
\item
    celestial {\rpo s}
\end{enumerate}

http://www.cns.gatech.edu/courses/chaosSpring06

In my \KS\ work with Christiansen, Putkaradze and Lan we
had excluded them ``by hand", by concentrating only on the space of
antisymmetric solutions. That is not good physics, as perturbations off
them mix into the full space of asymmetric solutions.

A relative equilibrium (RE) is a solution which travels along an orbit of the symmetry group
at constant speed. They are pervasive in applications such as celestial mechanics, molecular
dynamics, mechanical systems, and fluid mechanics. An introduction to the theory of RE can
be found in Chapter 4 of Marsden [14].

\subsection{{\Rpo s} in point vortex systems}

Testing bibtex - these should exist:
\refrefs{lop05rel,McCordMontaldi} \refrefs{Vanderb}

Laurent-Polz\rf{Laurent-Polz04} say: We give a method to
determine {\rpo s} in point vortex systems.

perform a symplectic reduction on a fixed point submanifold in
order to obtain a two-dimensional reduced \statesp. The method
is applied to point vortices systems on a sphere and on the
plane, but works for other surfaces with isotropy (cylinder,
ellipsoid, ...). The method permits also to determine some
{\reqva} and heteroclinic cycles connecting these {\reqva}.

{\Reqva} are orbits of the symmetry group action which are in-
variant under the flow, this corresponds here to motions of
point vortices which are stationary in a steadily rotating
frame. The existence and nonlinear stability of {\reqva} formed
of three vortices have been studied respectively in [KN98] and
[PM98].

Periodic orbits on the sphere were determined in [ST,To01]
thanks to the following method: they reduced the system to
two-dimensional systems by a symmetric reduction (using some
finite subgroups of $SO(3)$); the computation of the dynamics
on the reduced spaces permits then to determine periodic
orbits. Our paper is devoted to transpose that method to
determine {\rpo s}. To this end, we combine a symmetric
reduction together with a symplectic reduction.

[Third Referee's Report Dr Newton]:
The manuscript considers {\rpo s} in point vortex systems that
arise from splitting {\reqv} configurations. It more
comprehensively treats problems of the type considered in
Souliere and Tokieda (2002) and Tokieda (2001). It is a very
nice paper.

\subsection{Antisymmetric subspace}
%\label{s:AntisymmSubspFlot}


Perhaps there is some way of plotting the unstable manifolds too. If
there is only one unstable direction (in the full Fourier space
representation), the corresponding eigenvector is a unique loop function
$h[s] =  h(u(s),v(s),w(s))$ in the $(u,v,w)$ space, and the unstable manifold
$U$ is swept out by evolving in time the perturbed loop
$L[s] + \delta h[s] =  L(u(s),v(s),w(s)) + \delta h(u,v,w)$
$\to$ $L[s,t]$.
Complex eigenvector defined unstable manifold plane seems
harder to visualize;  It would be interesting
to look at heteroclinic connections in the $(u,v,w)$ space, as
behavior of higher-frequency modes in Fourier reps is a bit
hard to get used to.

\bigskip

The \KSe\ in  form \refeq{ks} is used, among others, in
\refrefs{cross93,Mks86,ks04com}.

\bigskip

In the Fourier representation they satisfy
the \eqv\ condition for \refeq{expan}
\beq
\left( \frac{k^2}{\tildeL^2} - \frac{k^4}{\tildeL^4}  \right)\, a_k
    \PCedit{
    -  \frac{i k}{2\tildeL} \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} a_m a_{k-m}
            }
  = 0
\,.
\label{eq:stfks}
\eeq

\bigskip

There appears to be a heteroclinic connection from \EQV{2}
{\eqv} unstable spiral out straight into \EQV{3}~{\eqv}
$\period{} = 76.6$ \rpo\ seems like a close-by relative of
this. That also means that the relative shift between the two
{\eqva} is fixed, as far as this connection is concerned.

Isn't there another $ \EQV{2} \to \EQV{3} $ heteroclinic from
the same point on  \EQV{2} circle that connects to a different
point on \EQV{3} circle?

\PC{refFig~{f:KS22rpo} goes to Vaggelis thesis - removed it from the paper,
    as the color schme is different from Ruslan's
   }
It is imperative that we start using the discrete symmetries, and only 1/2
of trajectory when it is selfdual.
\EQV{1}, \EQV{2} and \EQV{3} and unstable eigenvectors
we care about all happen to sit in the antisymmetric subspace
(recheck...), so connections should reflect these multiplicities. We have
one $\EQV{2} \to \EQV{3}$ and $\EQV{2} \to \EQV{2}$ (shift by $L/4$).

The \rpo\ {\nameit}55 travels between the 2-\eqv\  and
2-\eqv\ shifted,
with period and shift
$\period{p}=55.5953\,,\ d=5.24725$
Compared to $L/4 = 5.5$
this is nice, but why not close to periodic after 2nd return? Why 4th return?

The {\nameit}2 {\eqv}
captures qualitatively the mean velocity frame \rpo\ {\nameit}55 shape,
which follows the
{\eqv} for most of the time, except for a quick swing where it
sidesteps by $d/4$, just as it does in reffig~{f:rpo55}.

\Rpo\ {\nameit}55 looks similar to Davidchack's  orbit
of period
$\period{p}=47.64$ and $d=5.6759$. The period appears to depend on how
many times the orbit manages to spiral around the \eqv.
For {\nameit}55 that appears to be
1.5 times per period, rather than 2. This would led as
to
think there is a family of \rpo s along with a 3rd unit eigenvalue of
$gJ$,
but such does not exist.
So there has to be a selection mechanism corresponding to
reaching or missing the neighborhood of an \eqv\  point starting from
the neighborhood of the other.

The $u$ space time evolution reffig~{f:rpo55u} % rpo22-55-4-u
is plotted with the same starting instant,
so one can also track also the spatial profile $u$ in parallel with
the Fourier space projections.

So it is almost impossible to see reffig~{f:rpo55}(b) %rpo22-55-4-cm
in reffig~{f:rpo55}(a) % rpo22-55-4.
I can see 4 periods in reffig~{f:rpo55}(a), %po22-55-4,
but not in reffig~{f:rpo55}(b) %rpo22-55-4-cm
where it comes back only after full period $\period{p}=55.6$.

It still seems that it could be made relative periodic
(modulo a reflection symmetry?)
in $\period{p}/4=55.6/4=13.9$? That would be OK
-
by symmetry the figure 8 connecting
2 symmetric {\eqva} could consist of 4 identical segments: from
{\eqv} A to midplane, then reflected version of the same to SA, and
back again.

The two {\eqva}
capture qualitatively the mean velocity frame \rpo\ {\nameit}55 shape,
which follows the
{\eqv} for most of the time, except for a quick swing where it
sidesteps by $d/4$, just as it does in reffig~{f:rpo55}.

Please also plot it in plane, chose small Fourier coefficients
 which respect the $x \to -x$ symmetry of \KSe.
Then the symmetry of 2 mean velocity
{\eqva} and self-dual symmetry of \rpo\ {\nameit}55 will be explicit.

a large system: $|u(x)|$ can be easily deformed by long wavelength
perturbations. This \underline{must} be understood. Proposal:

There are two
marginal eigenvalues, one for time translation, one for
rotational invariance.
The sign of $\ExpaEig_{1}=-57$ says this is a Moebius-kind orbit,
inverse hyperbolic.
Stability exponent
 $\eigExp[1]=0.07$ says that this neighborhood is much less repelling than
the central {\eqv} A, a better candidate for being embedded into the
ergodic attractor.

The \rpo\ initial condition is
so accurate the orbit in reffig~{f:rpo55}(b)

% the largest unstable multiplier is
% $-57.17$ per period of the orbit - error would grow to $\approx 60^7
% = 2,800,000,000,000$.

For a numerical check of the \rpo\ stability eigenvalues,
used two inital
points along an unstable eigenvector $\jEigvec{1}$
at radial distance  $\approx 10^{-4}$ from the \eqv\ {\nameit}2,
and the initial inter-point separation $\Delta(0) \approx 10^{-5}$.
Integrated for time equal to the period $\period{p}=26.3556$ as calculated from
the \jacobianM\ and computed the leading Lyapunov exponent from the ratio of
final to initial distance
$\Lyap= \frac{1 }{ \period{}}\ln( \Delta(\period{})/\Delta(0))$.
Get
$\Delta(\period{})/\Delta(0) =39.01$,
$\Lyap=0.13902$, in agreement with the \eqv\ {\nameit}2
expanding eigenvalue $\Lyap=0.13904$

This observation can be heuristically motivated as follows.
\PC{this argument keeps worrying me: there are lots of solutions, like
$u=0$, that are {\eqva}, but isolated -
they are no place near asymptotic dynamics.
Do they belong to the invariant manifold?
   }
\Eqva\ are solutions valid for all times, and are thus points
on the finite-dimensional compact inertial manifold\rf{infdymnon}.
Finite dimensionality of the inertial manifold
bounds the size of Fourier components of all solutions.
This
compact inertial manifold and the dynamics on it can be
described by analytic functions of a finite number of Fourier modes.
\PC{explain the theory; say that in practice it is useless}
On a finite-dimensional compact manifold,
an analytic function can only have a finite number
of zeros. So the {\eqva}, {\ie},
the zeros of a smooth velocity field on
the inertial manifold, are finitely many.
The number of {\eqva} increases exponentially with $L$,
\PC{give reference for ``exponential growth''}
for infinite system size $L \to \infty$,
there are infinitely many {\eqva}.
\PC{is there a reference where this is explained?}

\bigskip

To illustrate the rapid contraction in the non-leading eigendirections
we plot  in [MAYBE INCLUDE] % reffig~{f:eigenvalues}
the eigenvalues of the \eqv\ in the unstable regime,
for relatively small system size, % low viscosity $\nu$,
and compare them with the
stability eigenvalues of the least unstable cycle for the same
system size.
The `laminar' \EQV{0}~\eqv\ is very unstable,
with many unstable eigendirections.


\bigskip

Even though our starting point \refeq{ks} is an infinite-dimensional
dynamical system, the asymptotic dynamics unfolds on a
finite-dimensional attracting manifold, and so we are back on the
familiar territory: the theory of a finite number of ODEs applies to
this infinite-dimensional PDE as well.

\bigskip

It is very unlikely that a single 1-$d$ Poincar\'e section, can
do the job, previous work\rf{LanThesis,lanCvit07} always needed
several sections.

The idea is that the local unstable plane gives 2 coordinates, the
least contracting direction (or one of a complex pair) gives the 3rd.

We need to construct the backbone of heteroclinic connections
first. They are not like 3-$d$ R\"ossler and Lorenz examples:
here one spirals out,
then spirals in - hopefully there will be intelligent Poincar\'e sections
transverse to initial \EQV{2} (or {\EQV{3)} unstable manifold, mapping onto
Poincar\'e sections of trajectories leaving again
the next \EQV{3} or \EQV{2} unstable manifold.

For all spatial plots color axis $u \in [-3, 3]$ is the same,
same time units and spatial width $L$.
For the steady states the magnitude of the \EQV{2} is quite
a bit smaller than that of the \EQV{3}.

On the
    $[a_?,a_?]$ plane
    the $\sigma x = -x$ symmetry of \KSe\ is explicit.


As it looks, will not help us with partitioning, it seems, unless there is
a trajectory that hits the contracting direction - maybe
( -0.11941393,0)
head on.

Might want to look at this blowup in
the \EQV{2} slowest contraction
$   ( -0.08402656 \pm i 0.16019413)$
complex eigenvectors plane, check whether the

Question is still - why does all of the unstable manifold of
\EQV{2}~\eqv\ go back
into
\EQV{2}~\eqv?


\underline{1-\reqv\  (traveling wave).}
% Ruslan L Davidchack,  10 Jul 2006
There is a pair of {\reqva}
${\nameit}1L$,
${\nameit}1R$
(traveling waves), dual under the
$u(x) \to -u(-x)$ symmetry. They are
determined numerically by
adiabatic continuation from a smaller system size
$L~\approx 12$,
where they are stable, to $L=22$
where their velocity is atypically large, $c=0.737$,

Their exponents are:
\\
$\Lyap_i \pm \theta_i =
(
\\
  0.1156222 \pm 0.817289,   \\
  0.033663 \pm 0.418909,    \\
 0.0                    ,   \\
 -0.245729                    , \\
 -0.321321 \pm 0.98126,
\cdots
)$

{\bf PC}:
Plot also the two \eqva\ of \eqva\ points, their
real eigenvectors and their complex eigenplanes. All {\eqva} presumably
wind around these, and as box size $L$ changes, they form continuous
families with smoothly changing $E$. One can check that by
changing $L$ a bit and using the previous \eqv\ to find the next
one.

What does the complex eigenplane continuation does for these
{\eqva} - does it produce nice heteroclinic connections, or is it
weirder? We know there is an analytic formula for a heteroclinic
connection (see \refref{LanThesis}). % Lan's thesis).

Linearization of the flow around $C_{+}$ yields the cubic equation
  \beq
\eigExp(1+\eigExp^2) = 4 \expctE
  \ee{flot:KSeqvCubic}
for the
stability eigenvalues
$\eigExp[j] = \eigRe[j] \pm i \eigIm[j]$.
% of \refeq{KSeqvStab}.
They can
be given in any of the standard analytical forms for cubic
roots  (all useless in practice), such as
\beq
[ 2\eigRe \,, -\eigRe \pm i \eigIm ]
    \,,\qquad
\eigRe=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\sinh \phi
\,,\qquad
\eigIm=\cosh \phi \, ,
\ee{flot:eqvEqvEigV}
with $\phi$ fixed by $\sinh 3\phi=3\sqrt{6\expctE}$.

The pair of \reqva\
${\nameit}2L$,
${\nameit}2R$
exists for larger system sizes, but does not continue
adiabatically\rf{KNSks90} down to $L=22$.

I've used the same \KSe\ convention as Kassam and Trefethen.
If you google '\KS\',
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Kuramoto-SivashinskyEquation.html is
the first in the search list and it uses the same convention
(actually, their $u$ is actually a $w$ such that $w_x$ is my $u$.)
The site refers to a 1986 Physica D paper by Michelson and a
``Handbook of differential equations" by Zwillinger, but I haven't
seen either of these.

\noindent {\bf When is an \eqv\ important? a bit of speculation}
%
There are two kinds of roles
{\eqva} play:
(1)
a {\em `hole' in the natural measure}.
The more unstable eigendirections an \eqv\ has (for example, the
$u=$const \eqv~\EQV{0}), the more unlikely it is  that
an orbit will recur in its neighborhood.
(2)
{\em Unstable manifolds of the `least unstable' {\eqva}}.
Empirically, asymptotic dynamics tends to spend
a large fraction of time in
neighborhoods of a few  {\eqva} with
a least number of unstable eigendirections.




\subsection{Numerical searches for \rpo s}

% \subsection{Newton's method for determining \reqva}


The problem one faces with high-dimensional flows is
that their topology is hard to
visualize, and that even with a decent starting guess for a point on
a periodic orbit, standard methods like Newton-Raphson are likely to fail.
Methods that start with initial guesses for a number of points along the
cycle, such as the multi-point shooting methods,
% of refsect~{s-MultShoot},
are more robust.

  Our first task is to determine all \eqva\
and  \reqva\ of the \KS\ system for a given fixed domain size
$L$. This problem is equivalent to finding periodic orbits of a
3-$d$ ODE system \refeq{eq:3dks} together with determining
appropriate value of the integration constant $E$. In
\refrefs{CvitLanCrete02,lanVar1,LanThesis,lanCvit07} they are
determined by a variational {\descent} method; for {\eqva}
determined here, straight Newton method sufficed.

% In the current investigation
%we prefer to search for \eqv\ solutions in
% the Fourier space
% \ beq
%  \dot{b}_k=\dot{c}_k=0
% \,.
% \eeq
% This is inefficient comapred to the above 3-$d$ ODE methods, but
% it serves as a warmup for, and the first test of methods that we then use
% to locate \po s and \rpo s.

%  Expanding $\dot{b}_k(a)$ and $\dot{c}_k(a)$ around our initial guess $a_o$ and demanding that they satisfy the \eqv\
%  condition, we get
%  \bea
%   \dot{b}_k(a) & = & \dot{b}_k(a_o)+\left.\frac{\partial \dot{b}_k}{\partial b_j}\right|_{a_o}\delta b_j + \left.\frac{\partial \dot{b}_k}{\partial c_j}\right|_{a_o}\delta c_j = 0 \continue
%   \dot{c}_k(a) & = & \dot{c}_k(a_o)+\left.\frac{\partial \dot{c}_k}{\partial b_j}\right|_{a_o}\delta b_j + \left.\frac{\partial \dot{c}_k}{\partial c_j}\right|_{a_o}\delta c_j = 0
%  \eea
%  or in matrix form
%  \beq
%     \left( \begin{array}{cc}
%         \frac{\partial \dot{b}}{\partial b} & \frac{\partial \dot{b}}{\partial c} \\
%         \frac{\partial \dot{c}}{\partial b}   & \frac{\partial \dot{c}}{\partial c}

%% ES Sep 11 2006 Commented out PC text. Added appendix with details of
%% Calculations to answer JFG question of Sep 7 2006.
%PC incorporated JFG Sep 7 2006 remark:
% Additional computational savings can be achieved
% for the \KS\ solutions that are restricted
% to the antisymmetric subspace of refsect~{s:AntisymmSubsp}.
% For the 3-$d$ ODE periodic solution this symmetry reduces
% the length of the loop by factor $1/2$. In the Fourier representation
% the continuous translation symmetry is eliminated by
% setting  the coefficients to purely imaginary values $i a_k$,
% thus reducing the dimensionality of the (truncated) \statesp\
% by factor 2. In fluid dynamics such savings are very significant,
% and are enforced whenever possible; for small cell \KS\ systems
% studied here they are not so important, and we search for such
% \eqva\ in the full space, and use the size of the (symmetry violating)
% real Fourier coefficients as an
% additional test of the accuracy of our Newton searches.

{\bf PC}: STUDY - this suggests that \expctE\ grows with system size:
   The last type of solution identified in \refref{ksgreene88}
   appears at point $F$  in the original reffig~{fig:GreeneKim}
   and is called a
   `giant' state because its amplitude grows as the system size
   increases.



{\bf PC}: bit weird: can use Galilean invariance to
    set $\expctE=0$ for any given $u(x,t)$?


{\bf ES}:  We can, but this effectively
sets $a_0$ to some value. The rate of change of energy depends only on the
non-zero modes only and thus the value of energy will not remain zero. I don't
see any problem with this.
}

{\bf RLD}: But it's the same as with kinetic energy, which is zero
in the reference frame that is moving with the object. Right?

% JFG Sep 7 2006: Do you then
% enforce real-valuedness in your Newton-descent via the constraint
% $a_{-k} = a^*{k}$ (the conjugates that then appear in the equations
% are nondifferentiable which is a big pain) or do you let the solutions
% go complex and then choose the real part at the end?
% The cost of that
% is that the dimension of your search space is twice as big as it needs
% to be. That's an unacceptable cost in fluids; perhaps in \KS\ it is not.
% In any case, I think you should (1) either clarify that you're no
% longer working in the antisymmetric subspace or eliminate its mention
% earlier, and (2) explain how you ultimately arrive at real-valued
% solutions.


\subsection{Bridges says:}

p.j. aston SIAM J Math Anal. in 1990 - first showed how the sequence of bifurcating branches
are related to each other by the scaling symmetry of KS

John Elgin and Wu did all this hook orbit stuff, bottleneck orbits, followup on
\refref{kskent92}

perturbations with respect to $L$ are modulational instabilities, or Eckhaus  instabilities

For example, the energy of \reqva\ \REQV{\pm}{2} which
seems close to the
mean turbulent energy in reffig~{f:drivedrag} is separated
from it when plotted along the
$\expct{u \, u_{x}{}^2}$ moment, where according to
\refeq{Bridges1} it takes nonzero value $c P$.

\subsection{Eigenvalues for high $k$}

We need to include  \EQV{0}
in reffig~{f:KS22EkEigs} and similar figures, because
PC believes that for larger $k$ all solutions have the same eigenvalues. This
    would enable us to separate dynamical from "hyper-diffusion" spectra,
    tell us how many are dynamically significant. This is different from Navier-
Stokes,
    which has zillion contracting complex eigenvalue pairs.

\subsection{Computing energy from Fourier modes}
The energy of $u(x)$ is defined as
\[
   E = \frac{1}{L}\int_0^L \textstyle\frac{1}{2}u^2(x) dx
\]
In terms of Fourier modes
\[
   E = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}|a_k|^2 =
   \sum_{k=1}^\infty |a_k|^2
\]

 with symmetry (2) within $\period{} < 200$ as there are \rpo s within $\period{} <
 100$. The reasoning is that it shouldn't be any harder to match
 $-u(-x+d,\period{}/2)$ and $u(x,0)$, than it is to match $u(x+d,\period{})$ and
 $u(x,0)$, provided the dynamics is equally mixing for all types of
 orbits.  If this is true, then the number of \po s with period smaller
 than $\period{}/2$ should be approximately equal to the number of \rpo s with
 period smaller than $\period{}$; the equality improving with increasing
 $\period{}$.

   } %end RLD

ES:{ I think we don't need the extra $\shift$. In the case with no reflection
the shift is uniquelly determined. In the case with reflection, since the term \rpo\
refers to the action of any group element under which the flow is invariant (not
necessarily translations) we can define this type of \rpo\ through
\[
  \Refl u(x,\period{p}) =
  -u(-x,\period{p}) = u(x,0) = u_p(x)\,.
\]
The \rpo s related to the action of $\Refl\Shift_{\shift/L}$ are equivalent (by translation) to
the last case (this is what Ruslan's footnote in refsect~{sec:L22} shows). Thus
there is no notion of shift associated with preperiodic orbits.
} %end ES

RLD:{
The reason I've introduced arbitrary $\shift$ is that this allows
the definition of the whole family of equivalent orbits related
by $\Shift_{\shift/L}$.  I agree with Vaggelis that, in case of \rpo s
without reflection, it makes no difference, since the condition
\refeq{KSrpos} remains true in any spatial reference frame.  So we could
drop $\shift$ here.

However, in the case of \po s (AKA \rpo s with reflection),
removing $\shift$ makes the condition \refeq{KSpos} valid only in
a specific reference frame, which is different for different \po s.
Hence the condition as written in \refeq{KSpos} cannot be used to
find \po s (i.e., you cannot derive \refeq{KSposFour} from it).

Now, if we don't use $\shift$ in \refeq{KSrpos}, but use it in \refeq{KSpos}
(like in \refeq{KSpos1}), then the two definitions are not equivalent,
since \refeq{KSrpos} defines just one orbit from the family related
by $\Shift_{\shift/L}$, while \refeq{KSpos1} defines the whole family.
   } %end RLD

ES:{ We can derive \refeq{KSposFour} by reversing Ruslan's proof:
applying $\Shift_{\shift/L}$ on \refeq{KSpos} we get
 $\Refl\Shift_{-2\shift/L}\left(\Shift_{\shift/L}u(x,T)\right)=\Shift_{\shift/L}u(x,0)\,,$
a condition for a \rpo\ of type \refeq{KSpos} in the translated frame, from which we get
\refeq{KSposFour}, to be used in practice since our initial guess might be translated
to another frame of reference.
The argument is that orbits of type \refeq{KSrpos} and \refeq{KSpos}
exist and are unique up to translational invariance.
We then can present the complications due to
translational invariance in their determination separately.
} %end ES


RLD:{
    The shift $\shift_p$ cannot be defined
    uniquely for a given pre-periodic orbit.  Let's say
    $\Refl\Shift_{\shift_p/L} u(x,\period{p}) = u(x,0)$.  The same
    orbit translated by any $\shift$ satisfies the condition
    $\Shift_{\shift/L}\Refl\Shift_{\shift_p/L} u(x,\period{p}) =
    \Shift_{\shift/L}u(x,0)$, or, since $\Shift_{\shift/L}\Refl = \Refl\Shift_{-\shift/L}$,
    this can be rewritten as follows:
    $\Refl\Shift_{(\shift_p - \shift)/L}u(x,\period{p}) =
    \Refl\Shift_{(\shift_p - 2\shift)/L}[\Shift_{\shift/L}u(x,\period{p})] =
    \Shift_{\shift/L}u(x,0)$, and so the new shift is now $\shift_p - 2\shift$.  Therefore
    $\shift_p$ can have any value depending on the spatial reference frame.  For example,
    we can always find a reference frame where $\shift_p = 0$ and thus the pre-periodic
    orbit satisfies the condition $u(x,\period{p}) = -u(-x,0)$.

\section{Example dynamical systems used throughout this work}
    \label{s:exampleIntro}
% Chapter Introduction, section Example dynamical systems used throughout the thesis.
% $Author$ $Date$
% Label: s:exampleIntro

In this section we briefly introduce some dynamical systems
that will be used as simple examples to demonstrate various
concepts in later chapters.

\paragraph{Lorenz, refchap~{chap:Lorenz}:}
%
\ES{Perhaps say Lorenz flow, complex Lorenz flow etc.}
Lorenz introduced his celebrated equations\rf{lorenz} as a
severe truncation of the Navier-Stokes equations describing
Rayleigh-Benard flow. They read
\index{Lorenz equations}
\begin{align}
\dot{x} &= \sigma (y-x) \notag \\
\dot{y} &= \rho x - y - x z \\
\dot{z} &= x y - b z \notag
\end{align}
where $\sigma$ the Prandtl number, $\rho$ the Rayleigh number
and $b$ an aspect ratio of the problem.

\paragraph{Armbruster-Guckenheimer-Holmes:}
%
Armbruster, Guckenheimer and Holmes, \refref{AGHO288},
introduced a simple system with $\On{2}$ symmetry:
\index{Armbruster-Guckenheimer-Holmes flow}
\beq
\begin{split}
  \dot{z}_1 &=\bar{z}_1 z_2
              + z_1\left(\mu_1+ e_{11}|z_1|^2+e_{12}|z_2|^2\right) \\
  \dot{z}_2 &=\pm z_1^2
              + z_2\left(\mu_2+ e_{21}|z_1|^2+e_{22}|z_2|^2\right)
  \label{eq:AGH}
\end{split}
\eeq
where $z_1,z_2\in \mathbf{C}$ and $\mu_j$ and $e_{jk}$ real
parameters. Details on the motivation of those equation will be
given in a later chapter.

This system corresponds to the first few terms in the center
manifold reduction of a $O(2)$-symmetric partial differential
equation near a codimension two bifurcation.

\paragraph{{\CLf}, refchap~{chap:lasers}:}
%
Gibbon and McGuinness\rf{GibMcCLE82} introduced {\CLf}
\beq
\begin{split}
	\dot{x}_1 &= -\sigma x_1 + \sigma y_1\cont
	\dot{x}_2 &= -\sigma x_2 + \sigma y_2\cont
	\dot{y}_1 &= (r_1-z) x_1 - r_2 x_2 -y_1-e y_2 \cont
	\dot{y}_2 &= r_2 x_1 + (r_1-z) x_2 + e y_1- y_2\cont
	\dot{z} &= -b z + x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2
	\label{eq:introCLeR}
\end{split}
\eeq
as a low-dimensional model of baroclinic instability in the
atmosphere. {\CLf} is equivariant under the action of
$\SOn{2}$.

 \paragraph{\KS, refchap~{chap:KSe}:}
 The \KS\ system
 \beq
   u_t = F(u) = -{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}(u^2)_x-u_{xx}-u_{xxxx}
     \,,\qquad   x \in [-L/2,L/2]
 \ee{intro:ks}
 was introduced by
 Kuramoto and Tsuzuki\rf{ku} as a phase equation for
 reaction-diffusion systems described by Complex Ginzburg-Landau
 equation and independently by Sivashinsky\rf{siv} to describe
 instabilities in laminar flame fronts.

 By Jin-Quan Chen, Jialun Ping (looks nice, get it):

``A sum of the elements belonging to a class is called class operator.
Class operators need not be unitary.They commute with every element of
$\Group$, hence they commute among themselves.
They are closed under multiplication. They form a class algebra.''

 misleadingly called a \emph{spatio-temporal symmetry} of the

 orbit mapped into other segments within the \statesp\ of a

``
For this, and the preceding chapter only, we also relax the nomenclature
a bit:
   `trajectory' is here understood in the dynamical sense,
   both in the full and in the \reducedsp,

   `Equilibrium' refers to fixed point of a map as well,
   with `fixed point' reserved to the group actions only.

Our labeling convention is usually
lexical, \ie, we label a cycle by the periodic point whose label has the
lowest value, and we label a class of degenerate cycles
by the one with the lowest label $\hat{p}$.
In what follows we shall drop the hat in $\hat{p}$ when it is clear
from the context that we are dealing with symmetry distinct classes
of cycles.
