the \mslices, I talked to experimentalists

and
\HREF{https://www.irphe.fr/~legal/}{Patrice Le Gal}
(studies instabilities and transitions of rotor-stator flows) about
implementing numerically the `nearest group orbit point' distance for
\emph{experimental} video images of flows. Experimentally collecting the
full 3D velocity vector field information is not feasible, but as the
physical dimension of the inertial manifold for transitional
boundary-shear flows in a minimal cell might be as low as 100 to 1,000
dimensions, well constructed projections from 100,000 to
1,000,000-dimensional \statesp s might capture the topology and correctly
identify the nearest neighbors. In the fluids community everybody worries
about choices of `norms', especially the control engineers who have to
optimize perturbations in order to attain desired ends. People agree that
there is no compelling reason to use the energy norm, other than that
velocity fields is what is given in a numerical computation. In practice
people use ``dissipation norms'', ``compensatory norms'', \etc, \etc.

My first thought has been to define a Gaussian-smeared out norm to
compare Hamming (pixel by pixel) distance between two images, smearing
being necessary to account for the sensor noise. Problem is that for
nonlinear flows this noise should not be isotropic\rf{LipCvi08,LipCvi07}
- it matters whether points compared are on unstable or stable manifolds,
etc. But as this is a pattern recognition problem, why not use the
accumulated wisdom of the pattern compression and pattern recognition
community?

\section{A letter to our experimental friends}

A modest proposal: jpeg and gif algorithms are optimized to reduce
the information content of an image. Optimization is for human vision,
but that might be OK for our purposes. So use not the raw, but the jpeg
compressed images, their [pixel$\times$pixel] size reduced to the
resolution realistically needed, each pixel a coordinate in the \statesp\
(if the proposal works, in later stages one might actually want to go into the jpeg algorithm and
start tweaking its parameters).
The group orbit is traced in this \statesp\ by translating a given image.
For example, in Le Gal's `French washing machine' experiments, or Mullin's
expanding pipe ones, the group orbit is traced out by rotating a given
image around the rotation axis, and the group tangent at a given image is
obtained by a minute angular rotation of a pattern. Pick a state of the
fluid that seems important and typical of the flow studies, and us it a
template. Its group tangent defines the slice hyperplane, and its group
curvature (the second derivative of the group orbit with respect to the
angle) both defines the \sset\ (the outer edges of the neighborhood that can be
associated with a given template), and an optimal coordinate to project
the group orbit and visualize it in a 2\dmn\ projection. The dynamics in
the slice is determined by step-by-step post-processing, \ie, by finding
the angle that satisfies the slice-group tangent orthogonality, and
rotating the full \statesp\ trajectory into the slice. This symmetry reduction is
lossless: it \emph{loses no information}, other than what was lost in
going from the raw image to the jpeg compressed image.

From the theoretical/numerical studies of flows with symmetries%
\rf{SCD07,ACHKW11}
we have learned that the reduced dynamics can be visualized in two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a video from the slice reduced video frames; in such video a
radially symmetric spiral pattern becomes a stationary \reqv\ (again, no
information lost - \emph{this is not averaging over the azimuthal
angle}), and turbulence reduces to turbulence with azimuthal drifts
removed.

    \item Project the \statesp\ trajectory on 2-3 coordinates formed from
dynamically important states of the fluid\rf{GHCW07}. There things like
bifurcation of a spiral in two spirals, or bifurcation of a torus into
two tori will be reduced to the garden variety dynamical systems
bifurcations.

    \item More importantly, experimental dynamics will reveal swirls and
close passages to invariant solutions that \emph{cannot} be discerned from the
symmetry-unreduced flow.

    \item The connection to numerics is now made by generating jpegs of
numerical flows visualized from the same vantage point as that of the camera
shooting the experimental flow. Once a nearby image is identified in the
numerical flow, one can run numerics to predict the future evolution, and
compare it with experimental flow, using Kalman filter data assimilation
to keep the numerical prediction close to the observed state of the
fluid.
\end{enumerate}

About slicing, sure it would be great to do this with experimental data.
Though in pipes we typically do not have the time information. Even with
simple flow visualization images we typically just look at a few
diameters in length (fixed in the lab frame) and turbulence advects past.
I guess we would have to visualize long sections for slicing to have the
necessary time information?

Something else which may be useful: we recently managed to converge
experimental velocity fields with the Newton method to TW solutions. What
we did is we took our experimental velocity data, stagger the
cross-sections together (i.e. convert time to space by using Taylor's
hypothesis) and then feed the 3D structure. Have a look at
\refref{deLMeAvHo12} (Predrag put a copy into the ChaosBook.org/library,
\HREF{http://ChaosBook.org/library/deLMeAvHo12.pdf}{click here}).  One
case is in there (figures 2 and 3). We just tried a second case (we only
tried two so far) and it converged to another traveling wave (to the
symmetric version of the one in the paper which is also on the edge). For
numerical people it may not be too extraordinary to converge something
with Newton but for experiments I did not expect this would ever work. We
will try this with turbulent data (i.e. non decaying) next.

We have also made progress with this volumetric PIV technique we can now
measure the full velocity field in a volume about one diameter streamwise
(this gives us some time information).

How about if we use a mixed experimental and numerical strategy? We could
use whatever velocity data we get from experiments (preferably 3D in a
volume) and get further time information from time stepping this in a
numerical code and then do the slicing ???

I will discuss further slicing possibilities in experiments with Marc.

\item[2012-01-02 Bj\"orn]
Further thoughts about slicing experimental data. I am still in favor of
doing this with velocity data rather than flow visualization images.

What is easy for us to do is to measure cross sections with all three
velocity components (like in the 2004 Science paper). If we do this fully
time resolved we can get about 100 D/U time units continuous data with
one measurement (after that the camera memory is full). Now the
difficulty then is that the information we get is the evolution in space
rather than in time. Meaning that we sample turbulent structures as they
are advected through our measurement cross section. But possibly this is
not a problem for the slicing technique and we can just ignore this to
some extend (??).

If that is the case I suggest the following procedure we take the 100 D/U
velocity data, and put a window of lets say 2.5 D over it. Inside this
2.5 D window we pretend turbulence is frozen in time, which gives us the
3D spatial information. Then we move this window across our data set
which gives us the time information.

Basically this way we get turbulence in a short BUT non periodic pipe.

Could we do slicing with this?? I would think that with this we can
probably identify traveling waves but I don't see how we could find
periodic orbits, for this we would need the time information.
