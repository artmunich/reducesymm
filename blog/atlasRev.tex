\subsection{Response 1.1}
\label{sect:Response1.1}

\begin{description}

\item[2012-07-01 Predrag] Not sure what to do with this report -
there are different paths to wisdom, and we cannot
write a different paper. Our point is that symmetry reduction is
necessary, so downplaying it is not what we want to do...

\bigskip

Referee: ``This paper is mainly a review of some techniques for symmetry reduction
that are useful for high-dimensional systems. In particular, the authors
present a method of constraining to a subspace called a "slice," or a set
of such subspaces. The method itself is not new, having been used in the
authors' references 3-6, but this paper presents a nice overview and
several interesting examples.''

\item[2012-07-16 Evangelos]
	Regarding novelty, I think that the idea of bringing together
	charts into an atlas has been proposed many times (including our
	own papers) but has not been implemented elsewhere. Should we
	emphasize this in the text?

{\bf [2012-07-16 Predrag]} to Evangelos: I have answered this question
several times in the blog above, but again, we presumably know the
literature, so
(1) can you give me one or more external references in which the
algorithm of constructing an atlas for the symmetry-reduced \statesp\ is
described?
(2) can you give me one or more external references in which the
$(d\!-\!2)$\dmn\ \emph{\poincBord} ${\cal S} \subset \PoincS$ is defined,
discussed, computed, explained?
(3) can you give me one or more references authored by us (or anyone
else) in which the \emph{ridge} is defined and constructed? I.e., a pair
of \KCedit{$(d\!-\!N)$\dmn\ } local \slice\ hyperplanes intersects in a
{ridge}, a \KCedit{$(d\!-\!N-\!1)$\dmn\ } hyperplane {\PoincS} of points
$\sspRed^*$ shared by a pair of charts and thus satisfying the \slice\
condition \refeq{PCsectQ0}.
{\bf [2012-07-17 Evangelos]} No, I can't and
that's exactly my point. This is all new but we do not emphasize it
properly, so it gives the impression of it all being review material.
I've slightly rephrased a sentence in the introduction to reflect novelty,
but I think we need to do more than this - emphasize it in the abstract,
conclusions and maybe introductory paragraph.
{\bf [2012-07-18 Predrag]} Now inserted bold novelty claims into the paper
and the response to the referees.

Also, I would remove, if possible, credit to Chaosbook.org for figures -
people think that if this is already in a book, then it has to be review
material.
 {\bf [2012-07-17 Predrag]} Done.

\item[(4) |x|] 2012-07-01 Predrag:

\item[minor (1) |x|] {\bf [2012-07-18 Daniel]:} Removed all references to
61,506 dimensions and replaced it with D dimensions, specifying that D is
large or just saying ``high-dimensional'' wherever necessary. Also took
d and D which were used in the text for dimensionality and replaced them
all with D's. Wrote comment outlining this change in \texttt{response1.1.txt}.
{\bf [2012-07-18 Predrag]}
ChaosBook.org convention is to use $d$ for \statesp\ dimension, $D$ for
configuration space dimension; Navier-Stokes pipe, etc. Reverted to $d$
throughout.

\item[minor (3) |x|] {\bf [2012-07-17 Daniel]:} Modified the text to try
and clarify ``turbulence breaks all symmetries'' and explain that
solutions calculated in invariant subspaces have different dynamics and
may have nothing to do with turbulence. Included review of changes in
\texttt{response1.1.txt}.

\item[minor 6. p9 |x|] 2012-07-01 Predrag:
 referee does not understand the difference between the `method of
 co-moving frames' and the `method of connections',
 \reffig{fig:BeThMconnect}. Shouldn't we weave Evangelos clarification
 into the text proper? {\bf [2012-07-17 Evangelos]} Done.

\item[minor (9) |?|] 2012-07-01 Predrag: can you weave this into the text?: ``
\edit{
Blah, blah}
''

\item[minor (11) |?|] 2012-07-01 Predrag:


\item[2012-07-19 Evangelos] Referee says: I described the manuscript as
self-focussed because about one third of the references are to the
authors' work.

We respond:
We feel referee's pain, having recently refereed a paper with 12
self-references out of 44 total, many of them deliriously misplacing the
credit.
*   Now there are 9 self-references (from the list of 44) that authors
    deem essential to this paper. By comparison, our internal
    symmetry-reduction blog cites 306 references.

ES: ``having recently refereed a paper'' means that we (\ie\ Predrag)
refereed one such paper or that the referee refereed our paper?

\item[2012-07-19 Evangelos] The ref. says:

I do not understand the remarks about sections and strobing, at the end
of section II: isn't it obvious that a Poincare section is not a
projection? and is it not obvious that strobing is a Poincare section
with the section being defined by time taking certain values? I.e. in an
extended state space the two are equivalent, aren't they?

RESPONSE: Not sure what an `extended' state space is.
(1) Our students often internally visualize a (d-1)-dimensional Poincare
section as one views a 3 dimensional world projected onto a 2-dimensional
photo (from one photo one cannot reconstruct the 3 dimensions), so that
remark was meant for them.
(2) suppose you strobe a periodic orbit of period $\pi$ every second.
({\bf ES:} What does every second mean here?)
What you get is a set of points that erotically fills out a
1-dimensional loop, whereas *stationary* Poincare section is
0-dimensional.

ES: Regarding remark (2), I think the referee has in mind systems with
explicit time dependence where one usually considers time as an extra
depended variable and defines a stroboscopic Poincar\'e section.

Or maybe what he has in mind is that you could think of the stroboscopic
condition as defining implicitly a manifold in phase space, which you
then call a Poincar\'e section. But then one really needs to carefully
choose the strobing period in order to get something meaningful in the
case of dissipative chaotic or turbulent system (as Predrag's example
shows).

\item[2012-07-19 Predrag]  I now realize that `strobing' remarks confuse
rather than aid the reader, and have removed them from the text.

\item[2012-07-19 Evangelos] Removed: ``the bit rushed submission that
reviewers have received (graduate students firmly believe that papers are
written one day before the deadline)'' from response. Do you really want
to trust an anonymous reviewer with behind the scenes details?

\subsection{Response 1.2}
\label{sect:Response1.2}

\begin{description}

\item[2012-07-14 Predrag] In response to referee's plaint:
``I described the manuscript as self-focussed because about one third of
the references are to the authors work.'' I removed a bunch of
Cvitanovi\'ciania, including Froehlich and Cvitanovi\'c (2011) paper, with
a heavy heart - Stefan did this work as undergraduate...

{\bf [2012-07-16 Evangelos]} I think you should not remove this. This is were
		slicing is formulated as an extremum condition. Also,
		I think the reviewer is pissed off about not citing (his)
		fluid dynamics papers - he does not care about this one.

{\bf [2012-07-16 Predrag]} thanks - Froelich is back.
