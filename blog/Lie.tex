\HREF{http://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/jdm}
{Master of Simplecticity}]
%{James Meiss}]
Never did I think I'd read the sentence ``It's a mess'' in a
\emph{Physica D} paper! But cool, nevertheless.

\item[2011-03-25 PC] keep reading:
``looking for periodic orbits in systems with only continuous symmetries
is a fool's errand.'' If you read to the end of Sect. 8 it gets worse:
``a serious nuisance.'' Another first for \emph{Physica D}.

\item[2011-03-17 JM]
In Eq.~(4) of \refref{SiCvi10} you say that every element of a Lie group
that is connected can be written as an exponential. This is false, I
believe. Some Lie groups are connected and some are not. $\SOn{n}$ is
connected, as is $Sp(n)$. But, just like for manifolds (indeed a Lie
group is just a manifold with a group structure), some groups can't be
covered by a single coordinate patch, or in this case by the exponential.
This is also related to the fact that the series for the  Log is not
globally convergent\rf{Hall03}.

\item[2011-03-17 PC]
Of course not {\em every} Lie group element needs to be continuously
connected to identity - that why the finely tuned statement in our humble
paper.
I need a lawyer.

\item[2011-03-17 JM] or a mathematician!

\item[2011-03-17 PC]
no, no, in your case I need a lawyer. We carefully
write above Eq.~(4):

``An element of a compact Lie group
continuously connected to identity can be written as''

We \emph{do not say}
``\emph{\color{red} every} element of a compact Lie group
\emph{\color{red} is} continuously connected to identity...''

% How can it be wrong? Goes back to Peter-Weyl, etc.
We write here
``continuously connected to identity'' so we do not need to point out
that $\On{n}$ has also elements of form (discrete operation $\times$
exponential rep of $\SOn{n}$ group element, where discrete group $Z_2$ is
$\{e,$inversion $\}$ (inversion$)^2=1$, and avoid talking about double
covers, \etc. The paper (as does the discussion of
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/chapters/continuous.pdf}
{Chapter 10 - Relativity for cyclists}) tries its utmost to minimize the
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/chapters/appendHist.pdf}{Gruppenpest jargon}
damage, which is a total turnoff to our intended audience of working
plumbers and electricians. If I may be so bold as to cite my foreman
plumber Fabian Waleffe, faculty member of a reputable mathematics
department in a union-busting state, upon my attempt to get him to read
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/chapters/discrete.pdf}
{Chapter 9 - World in a mirror}, chicken feed in comparison to the
continuous symmetry reduction nightmare:
	\PC{remember to include Barkley's \On{n} as an example of
		semi-direct product.}

``How many Tylenols should I take with this?... (never took group theory,
still need to be convinced that there is any use to this beyond
mind-numbing formalizations.)''

But it is obviously too subtle, will rewrite in the ChaosBook.org.

Now, more seriously - we do not need the explicit exponential form, we
only need to say that for a continuous group (compact or not) we can
linearize the flow in a neighborhood of any group element, and that
the tangent space is spanned by the Lie algebra. How to say it without
too much jargon?

\item[2011-03-17 JM]
Yes, every Lie group has a tangent space (since it is a manifold), and
the tangent space always has a Lie algebra structure. Technically, I
believe that one says that the Lie algebra is the tangent space "at the
identity". So $\SOn{n}$ and $\On{n}$ have the same Lie algebra, the
antisymmetric matrices. The Lie algebra of $Sp(n)$ is the set of
``Hamiltonian matrices.'' More fancily, people talk about the Lie algebra
as the set of left-invariant vector fields... but that always confuses
me.

\item[2011-03-17 PC]
``set of left-invariant vector fields?'' Probably not needed
for compact Lie groups (subgroups of the unitary group). There left
and right vectors are the same thing...

\item[2011-03-17 JM]
For example the symplectic group has elements that are not exponentials.
An example is the Jordan block $B=[[-I, I],[0,I]]$, which I learned from
Alex Dragt. A great reference on Lie groups is Hall\rf{Hall03}.

\item[2011-03-17 PC]
Thanks for introducing me to Dragt; I have now read and like his
\refref{Dragt05} (for CNSers - uploaded to zotero). I prefer the much
deeper \refref{PCgr} to Hall\rf{Hall03}, which I always found rather
pedestrian. \HREF{http://birdtracks.eu}{The Much Deeper} you can have for
a click (by contrast to The Much Cooler and very wonderful
\refref{Meisso7} for which I doled out cool cash). But maybe I should
have a second look... For PDE applications of symmetries
Hoyle\rf{hoyll06} is pretty gentle.


\item[2011-03-17 JM]
$Sp(n) = {\LieEl :  \LieEl^T {\bf \omega} \LieEl = {\bf \omega}}$
where $\LieEl$ is $[2n\!\times\!2n]$.

\item[2011-03-25 PC]
See \refrem{rem:symplectic} concerning notation for $Sp(n)$.

\item[2011-03-17 JM]
So matrix $B \in Sp(n)$, but it is not the exponential of a
``Hamiltonian matrix'' (a matrix of the form ${\bf \omega}S$, where $S$
is symmetric).

\item[2011-03-25 PC]
This is exercise 3.7.12 in in Dragt\rf{Dragt11}
It has not worked for me as yet:
By explicit calculation, $B^T {\bf \omega} B \neq {\bf \omega}$.
I am probably missing something, but it is a worthwhile exercise
to do... (Evangelos? Chao?)

\item[2011-03-25 PC]
Thanks for pointing out that this is called `Hamiltonian matrices.'
Curious: who named this `Hamiltonian matrices'? So far I've tracked it to 1971
(see \refrem{rem:symplectic}).
As a physicist, I hate
this misuse of a term well established in Quantum Mechanics since the
time of Heisenberg (See \refrem{rem:symplectic}). The recovered Irish
alcoholic did quaternions, but I believe that it was the Germans who
formalized the classification of semi-simple Lie algebras towards the end
of 19th century, with Cartan driving in the final stake.

Can you perhaps have a glance at
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/chapters/continuous.pdf} {Chapter 7 -
Hamiltonian dynamics}, see whether your hair raises? Spurred by you I'm
starting to incorporate more symplectic material, the first draft is
below, \refsect{sect:toCB}.

I care about splitting hairs because I'm trying to collect all possible
names for every single thing in ChaosBook.org commentary, together with
attributions.

\item[2011-03-17 JM]
But it seems you have the group $\SOn{n}$ or perhaps
$\Un{n}$ in mind. Because in the next paragraph
you say that the Lie algebra of your group is the set
of anti-hermitian matrices, and then you say it can be
brought into the anti-symmetric form. I thought this was
true only for the orthogonal group.

\item[2011-03-25 PC]
You are correct, from then on we use only  $\SOn{n}$, as Evangelos
explains here:

\item[2011-03-17 ES]
As we only have applications in mind where $(x_1,x_2,...,x_d)$ are real
coordinates and since any compact Lie group acting on $\reals^n$ can be
identified with a subgroup of $\On{n}$, we only consider $\On{n}$. Then, as
explained above, we only need elements connected to the identity and
therefore restrict attention to $\SOn{n}$.

\item[2011-03-17 JM]
I wasn't aware of this (subgroup) business. I'll have to read about that.

I take it you submitted your most recent paper to the Morrison
festschrift volume? I wrote a paper for that too.

\item[2011-03-17 PC]
Would you mind having a look at it,
\HREF{http://www.cns.gatech.edu/~predrag/papers/preprints.html\#FrCv11}
{\emph{Reduction of continuous symmetries}} \emph{of chaotic flows by the
method of slices}? It's on the same theme, and I'm afraid that until we
reduce KS, pipe flow and plane Couette flow symmetries there will be more
papers like this...

\item[2011-03-17 JM]
Sure, that was how I started, but then I decided I better read
your \emph{Physica D} paper first!

\subsection{Tangent space spanned by the Lie algebra}
\label{sect:tanSpace}

[NOT WRITTEN YET]
We only need to say that for a continuous group (compact or not) we can
linearize the flow , and that
the tangent space is spanned by the Lie algebra, without
too much jargon.

%\item[2011-03-17 JM]
% + Banks "Modern Quantum Field Theory" 2008 textbook, Appendix E
A Lie group is a group whose elements $\LieEl(\gSpace)$ depend smoothly
on a finite number of parameters $\gSpace_i$. In a neighborhood of a
given group element the linearization
\[
\LieEl(\gSpace+\delta\gSpace) \simeq \LieEl(\gSpace)
+ \delta\gSpace_i
	\frac{\partial \LieEl(\gSpace)}{\partial_i \gSpace}
\,,
\]
spans the \emph{tangent space}
at $\LieEl(\gSpace)$. With an application of the inverse of a group
element $\LieEl^{-1}$, this neighborhood can be mapped into a neighborhood
of the identity, so the
local structure of Lie groups can be understood
by studying the tangent space near the identity element,
generated by
\[
		\left.
	\LieEl(\gSpace)^{-1}
	\frac{\partial \LieEl(\gSpace)}{\partial_i \gSpace}
		\right|_{\gSpace=0}
\,.
\]
This can be written in a specific basis as

The tangent space with a Lie algebra structure.

For example, near the identity $\SOn{n}$ and $\On{n}$ have the same Lie algebra.


%\item[2011-03-17 JM]
The Lie algebra of $Sp(n)$ is the set of Hamiltonian matrices.


\subsection{Symplectic group}
\label{sect:SymplctGroup}

A symplectic matrix $\LieEl$ transformation preserves the
\emph{symplectic bilinear form} $\pSpace^T {\bf \omega} \pSpace$,
\beq
\LieEl^T {\bf \omega} \LieEl = {\bf \omega}
    \,, \quad\quad
{\omega} = \MatrixII{0}{\bf I}{\bf -I}{~0}
	\,,
\ee{symlectNorm}
where
%in the 2-dimensional case ${\bf \omega} = [[0,1],[-1,0]]$, and
$\LieEl^T$ denotes the transpose of $\LieEl$, ${\bf I}$ is the
[$\DOF\!\times\!\DOF$] unit matrix, and ${\omega}$ is, in general, the
[$2\DOF\!\times\!2\DOF$] {\em symplectic} form

If $\LieEl$ is symplectic, so is its inverse $\LieEl^{-1}$, and if
$\LieEl_1$ and $\LieEl_2$ are symplectic, so is their product $\LieEl_2
\LieEl_1$. Symplectic matrices form a group called the \emph{symplectic
group} $Sp(d)$.

A real $[\!2n\times\!2n]$ matrix of the form
\beq
H = \MatrixII{E}{F}{G}{-E^T}
\ee{HamMatr1}
is said to be Hamiltonian if $E, F, G \in \reals^{n \times n}$,
 with $F^T = F$ and $G^T = G$. Equivalently, one
may characterize the $[\!2n\times\!2n]$  Hamiltonian matrices $H$
in $\in \reals^{2n \times 2n}$ by
\beq
({\bf \omega}H)^T = {\bf \omega}H
\,.
\ee{HamMatr2}

Let $S$ be a real symmetric matrix. Matrices of the form ${\bf \omega}S$ are

A linear combination  of
Hamiltonian matrices is a Hamiltonian matrix, so
Hamiltonian matrices form a linear vector space. By symmetry of
$S$, its dimension (the number of independent components of a
$[\!d\times\! d]$ symmetric matrix) is
$N= d(d+1)/2 = \DOF(2\DOF+1)$. Choosing a set of $N$ linearly
independent Hamiltonian matrices $\Lg_a$ as a basis, we
can write

{\bf \omega}S

\ee{sympFiniteRot}
where ${\bf \omega}S$
is a {\em Lie algebra} element,  $\Lg_a$ is a Lie algebra generator,
and $\gSpace_a$ are the parameters
of the transformation. Repeated indices are summed throughout this
chapter, and the dot product refers to a sum over
Lie algebra generators.

In order to streamline the exposition, we

transformations with the discrete ones.

The commutator (Lie product) of two Hamiltonian matrices is a Hamiltonian
matrix, and can thus be expressed in the same basis,

	=
\Lg_a \Lg_b - \Lg_b \Lg_a
	=
i C_{abc} \Lg_c

\ee{sympComm}
where the real coefficients $C_{abc}$ are called the \emph{structure
constants} of the algebra. Thus the Hamiltonian matrices form an algebra
called the symplectic Lie algebra $sp(2n)$.
%As in (10), it can be shown that in general Lie groups and Lie algebras
%are related by exponentiation.

Symplectic matrices are by definition linear transformations that leave

implies that any symplectic matrix satisfies
\beq
\LieEl^T\omega \LieEl \,=\, \omega

and -- when $\LieEl$ is close to the identity $\LieEl=\matId + \delta t
\Mvar$ -- it follows that that $\Mvar$ must satisfy \refeq{Funny_L}.
\PC{isn't the next paragraph a repeat of this one?}

Consider now a smooth nonlinear change of variables of form $y_i=h_i(x)$,
and define a new function $K(x)=H(h(x))$. Under which conditions does
$K$ generate a Hamiltonian flow? In what follows we will use the notation
$\tilde{\partial}_j=\partial/\partial y_j$,
$s_{ij} =
% (\partial h)_{ji}=
\frac{\partial h_i}{\partial x_j}$
.
By employing the chain rule we
have that
%\GT{It would be nicer, conceptually, to define trafo(?) $x \to y= h(x)$
%and transform $H(x)$  into $K(y) = H(g(y)$ with $g = h^{-1}$. PC: as you

\tilde{\partial}_l H
s_{lj}
% \frac{\partial h_l}{\partial x_j}
\eeq
(Here, as elsewhere in this book, a repeated index implies summation.)
%\GT{Summation over repeated indicees defined?}
By virtue of \refeq{Ham_eQ} $\tilde{\partial}_l H=-\omega_{lm}\dot{y}_m$, so
that, again by employing the chain rule, we obtain
\beq
\omega_{ij} \partial_j K \,=\, -\omega_{ij} s_{jl}
% \frac{\partial h_l}{\partial x_j}
\omega_{lm}
s_{mn}
% \frac{\partial h_m}{\partial x_n}
\dot{x}_n
\eeq
The right hand side simplifies to $\dot{x}_i$ (yielding Hamiltonian
structure) only if
\beq
-\omega_{ij} s_{lj}
% \frac{\partial h_l}{\partial x_j}
\omega_{lm}
s_{mn}
%\frac{\partial h_m}{\partial x_n}
\, =\, \delta_{in}
\eeq
or, in compact notation,
\beq
-\omega (\partial h)^T \omega (\partial h) \,=\, \matId
\eeq
which is equivalent to the requirement \refeq{symlectNorm} that $\partial
h$ is symplectic. h is then called a {\em canonical transformation}.
\index{canonical transformation}
\index{symplectic!map}
We care about canonical transformations for two reasons.
%\toExam{exmp:UnderstFlows}
First (and this is a dark art), if the canonical transformation $h$ is
very cleverly chosen, the flow in new coordinates might be considerably
simpler than the original flow. Second,  Hamiltonian flows themselves are
a prime example of canonical transformations.

Exposition of \refsect{sect:SymplctGroup} follows Dragt\rf{Dragt05}.
There are two conventions in literature for what the integer argument of
$Sp(\cdots)$ stands for: either $Sp(D)$ or $Sp(d)$ (used, for example, in
\refrefs{Dragt05,PCgr}), where $\DOF$ = \dof, and $d=2\DOF$. As explained
in Chapter 13 of \refref{PCgr}, symplectic groups are the `negative
dimensional,' $d \to -d$ sisters of the orthogonal groups, so only the
second notation makes sense in the grander scheme of things.
Mathematicians can even make sense of the $d= $odd-dimensional case,
see ``Odd symplectic groups'' by Proctor\rf{Proctor88,GeZe84}, by dropping
the requirement that $\omega$ is non-degenerate, and defining
a symplectic group $Sp(\pS,\omega)$ acting on a vector space $\pS$
as a subgroup of $Gl(\pS)$ which preserves a skew-symmetric bilinear form
$\omega$ of \emph{maximal possible rank.} The odd symplectic groups
$Sp(2\DOF+1)$ are not semisimple.
If
you care about group theory for its own sake (our dynamical systems
symmetry reduction techniques are still too primitive to be applicable to
Quantum Field Theory), Chapter 14 is fun, too.

Any finite-dimensional symplectic vector space has a \emph{Darboux basis}
such that $\omega$ takes form \refeq{symlectNorm}.

Referring to the $Sp(d)$ Lie algebra elements as  `Hamiltonian matrices'
as one sometimes does\rf{Dragt05,wikiHamMat} unfortunately conflicts with
what is meant by a `Hamiltonian matrix' in quantum mechanics: the quantum
Hamiltonian sandwiched between vectors taken from any complete set of
quantum states. Not sure where this name comes from; Draft cites
\refrefs{Fulton91,Georgi99}, and  Chapter 17. of his own book in
progress%\rf{Dragt11}.
Fulton and Harris\rf{Fulton91} seem to use it.
Certainly Van Loan\rf{PaiL81} uses in 1981. Taussky in 1972.
Might go all the way back to
Sylvester?

Dragt\rf{Dragt05} convention for phasespace variables is as in
\refeq{2.7a}. He calls the dynamical trajectory $\xInit \to
\pSpace(\xInit,t)$ the `transfer map.' That is really regrettable.

In the mathematics literature the Lie operator $:f:$ is sometimes
referred to as $ad(f)$ where $ad$ is shorthand for adjoint. Dragt uses the
$:f:$ notation instead of $ad(f)$ because it facilitates the writing of
complicated expressions.

I call the matrix of second derivatives of the Hamiltonian, $S_{kn}=
\partial_k \partial_n H$, the `Hessian matrix.'
${\omega}_{ik}\,S_{kj}(\pSpace)$ in \refeq{Bew_Mon} is the (instantaneous)
{\stabmat} of the flow - it is a Hamiltonian matrix. Its integral along
the trajectory, the linearization of the flow ${\jMps}$ that I (as well
as Dragt\rf{Dragt05}) currently call the `\JacobianM' is symplectic.
Coordinate transformations whose gradient is symplectic are called
`canonical transformations'. Hamiltonian flow $\flow{t}{\pSpace}$ is a
canonical transformation, with the linearization $\jMps_{kn} = \partial_n
\flow{t}{\pSpace}_k$  a symplectic transformation.

Dragt and Habib\rf{DraHab08,Dragt05} have a nice concise discussion of
symplectic Lie operators and their relation to Poisson brackets:
incorporate this into the Liouville operator discussion in ChaosBook.org.

Curiosity: in \refref{Dragt11} Dragt says ``Sometimes Feigenbaum
diagrams are called bifurcation diagrams. However. strictly speaking,
bifurcation diagrams should also display the unstable fixed points, and
Feigenbaum diagrams generally do not.
[news to Predrag]
The use of the term bifurcation in
the context of dynamics is due to Poincar\'e.''
And he does not credit the other guy for the fixed-point equation.
The book is more extreme than even ChaosBook.org: 1872 pages. But
considerably more repetitive.

Flows generated by Killing fields are continuous isometries of the manifold. The flow generates a symmetry, in the sense that moving each point on an object the same distance in the direction of the Killing vector field will not distort distances on the object.

A vector field $X$ is a Killing field if the Lie derivative with respect to
 $X$ of the metric $g$ vanishes:
\beq
    \mathcal{L}_{X} g = 0 \,.

Killing vector fields can also be defined on any (possibly nonmetric)
manifold $\pS$ if we take any Lie group $\Group$ acting on it instead of
the group of isometries. In this broader sense, a Killing vector field is
the pushforward of a left invariant vector field on $\Group$ by the group
action.
If the group action is effective, then the space of the Killing vector
fields is isomorphic to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of $\Group$.

If the equations of motion can be cast in
Lagrangian form, with the Lagrangian exhibiting variational
symmetries\rf{Bluman07,BlumanAnco02}, Noether theorem associates
a conserved quantity with each Killing vector.
