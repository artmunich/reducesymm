\chapter{Burak's daily blog}
\label{c-dailyBlogBB}

\begin{description}

\item[2013-11-15  Predrag] Moved Burak's blog from \texttt{gitHub} exile 
to Evangelical home, \texttt{siminos/blog/dailyBlogBB.tex}.
The draft of the magic slice article still remains in the 
 \texttt{gitHub} exile \texttt{reducesymm/cgang/}. We have to respect Divakar's edicts.


\item[2013-11-12  Burak]
I added the abstract for Dynamics Days in \texttt{gitHub}

\texttt{reducesymm/blog/burak/DynamicsDays/twomodeabstract.tex}.
