\section{May 17, 2007 -- $s_1$, $s_2$, $\tau_x$, $\tau_z$ generate 16 irreps?}

{\bf PC}: My main problem is - we are currently using only 4 irreducible reps
of $C_2 \times C_2$ = $D_2$ dihedral group generated by $\tau_x, \tau_z$,
but why not 16 irreps of
the $D_2 \times D_2$ generated by $s_1, s_2, \tau_x, \tau_z$?
They all commute, each one splits the space of reps into 2.
Why stop at $U_S$ subspace?
There should be 16 discrete copies of any
general solution, not just 4.
However, there would still be 4 copies of UB, as UB is within the
fully symmetric irrep $A_1$ od $s_1, s_2$ $D_4$.

\section{Jun 13, 2007 Reading for Ruslan?}

Armbruster {\em et. al} showed that four complex Fourier
modes suffice to exhibit most
of the qualitative features of the dynamics,
for a wide range of system sizes\rf{AGHks89}.
