Title:      Reduction of continuous symmetries of chaotic flows
            by the method of slices
Authors:    Stefan Froehlich and P Cvitanovi\'c

The referee report is reproduced in full here, with author
responses listed in parenthetical comments, and revisions
indicated in green in the referee's copy of the article.

Reviewer #1: I recommend the following modifications to the
manuscript.

1. Coefficients are missing in the equation before equation
  (6), equations (12), (16) and (17). I do understand that
  since the equations are equal to zero, technically such
  coefficients can be removed. However it is misleading, please
  correct the equations.
[Authors: now corrected, thanks]

2. Page 5: The quotient space M/G is not a hyperplane,
  neither it is isomorphic to a hyperplane. As it is stated in
  the manuscript, the group orbit generally intersects more
  than once the representation hyperplane and additional
  criteria has to be used to pick up a unique solution. This
  point has to be clarified.
[Authors: thanks for pointing this out; our exposition here was
very muddled, hope the revised version is an improvement]

3. I agree with equation (8), which means that there a minus
  sign missing in the previous equation (sentence right before
  the equation). Please correct.
[Authors: now corrected]

4. Equation (11) does not appear to be correct. Besides, even
  corrected, the derivation of the equation is not
  straightforward. Some explanation should be considered to
  guide the reader.
[Authors: corrected the equation. Wrote out equation (A.9) to
reduce the amount of flipping back and forth between the
appendix. Aside from that, the derivation is just expanding to
move the sum outside of the inner product.]

5. Top of page 9: Inflexion points are not extrema but
  critical points. Please correct.
[Authors: now corrected]

6. I agree that the angular velocity diverges when a
  trajectory passes through the inflexion hyperplane. However,
  except at the exact instant of the discontinuity, the
  velocity is continuous. As a result, I do not get how it
  induces a Dirac discontinuity, as shown in figure 3. The same
  question could happen to other readers, so please clarify.
[Authors: added several sentences that hopefully explain this]

7. Part 4: The charting method is sound and promising in its
  general idea. However, its actual feasibility is not
  demonstrated in the manuscript. In particular a figure
  showing the result of such a reduction would be a strong
  proof of its feasibility.

8. Page 20: In the sentence after equation (A.6), the
  invariant point condition is either
  Tx=0 or T_a x=0 for a=1, 2, . N.
  Please clarify.

9. Page 20: A reference should be added to the reducibility
  of compact groups.

Minor corrections
10. Figure 1 has no color, contrary to what is indicated in
  the caption, which makes the figure more difficult to read.
  In particular, if black and white, the generic segment TW1
  (and E1) should be pointed out in the figure.
[Authors: added labels]

11. Generic symmetries are defined in equation (3). However,
  the symmetry group G (SO(2) in the example) is not defined
  there which might be confusing for the reader. Please
  clarify.

12. Page 9: In the sentence after equation (12), the word
  "the" is repeated.
[Authors: now corrected]

13. Page 9: The final equation is v=u+g^-1 d_t g Id.
[Authors:now corrected]

14. Page 11, in the sentence before equation (17), the
  numbering (1) and (2) of two conditions is confusing with
  equation labels.
[Authors: changed to letters]

15. Figure 4, left panel: For black and white printing, the
  difference between the two orbits is not obvious. A
  modification of the figure would be worthwhile.

16. Page 21: Before equation (B.1), the reference equation
  for angular velocities should be (14) instead of (6).
[Authors: now corrected]
