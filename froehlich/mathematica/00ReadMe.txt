IMPORTANT: Before you save your mathematica notebooks to commit them to the
repository, please click on menu Cell > Delete All Output. This will
remove all graphics and output expressions and render much smaller files
that are much easier for subversion and my slow internet connection to
handle. We can always execute your notebooks to see the output. If
something cannot run in a matter of minutes you need to export the
results anyway.



PlotCL.nb plots any trajectory of the complex Lorenz flow.

Infinitesimal.nb plots the trajectory when the calculation is
done using the method of moving frames for the hyperplane x1=0.

Hilbert1.nb calculates the trajectory of the flow in the
coordinates of a Hilbert basis.

Hilbert2.nb calculates the trajectory of the flow in standard
coordinates then converts the resulting flow into the
coordinates of a Hilbert basis.

Eig.nb calculates the eigensystem of the relative equilibrium
of the complex Lorenz system in the co-moving frame.

rpoNewton.nb uses Newton's Method to find relative periodic
orbits for the complex Lorenz equations.
