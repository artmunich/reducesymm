        PURA Letter of Recommendation

                Applicant Information

                Student Name: Froehlich, Stefan
                Student GTID: 902134531

                Faculty Advisor Information
                Faculty Name: Cvitanovic,Predrag
                Faculty Email: predrag.cvitanovic@physics.gatech.edu


                Recommendation Questions

=== The students ability to carry out the proposed project. Please include
any past or present experience supervising this student in research (for
pay or credit), in a course, or in another capacity. Mention, if
appropriate and known, any previous research the student has performed in
the past under other advisors or away from Georgia Tech if you believe it
has bearing.

As a junior, Froehlich was the best student in my
senior/starting graduate PHYS 4421 Physics of Continuous
Matter, Spring semester 2010 course, and he is doing well in
studying parts of my advanced graduate ChaosBook.org texbook.
He is a smart, focused student with good future in physics
and/or mathematics.

=== The relationship between the students project and your own research.

For his PURA project he will master and understand the
Navier-Stokes equations in the boundary-shear turbulence
problem my group is investigating, and with the help of my
former graduate student E. Siminos and of John F Gibson, the
author of the code, master the use of channelflow.org. The
proposed project is integral part of what my group has to
publish within a year or so - we are the only group that has
the exact solutions of Navier-Stokes that will be used by
Froehlich, but our time is better spent scaling our project up
to HPC implementation.

=== Explain how the funding will benefit both the student and yourself.
For example, does the funding completely enable the work to be undertaken
due to the students need for a part-time job? Or does the funding allow
you to begin research in a new area, follow a newly discovered trend in
your own research which is not currently funded, or develop an idea for a
possible new proposal?

Our theory of moderate Reynolds turbulence is opening a whole
new line of attack on understanding structures in boundary
layer flows, our small cohort (US, England, Germany, Japan) is
very hopeful about the long term impact on problems such as
control of turbulence. This research is funded by NSF (though
our competition outside of US is considerably better funded).
That's why funding Froehlich will help us. With his performance
so far, and if this project results in a publication, Froehlich
is heading for a top graduate physics program in the country -
that helps School of Physics in its student recruiting. His
proposed project is totally new, made possible only by advances
made by us in the past 2 years.

=== Overall Evaluation of Applicant Relative to Peers.

                Outstanding

=== Additional comments with respect to this applicant that you feel would
be helpful to UROP in making final PURA decisions.

I hope Froehlich will make us proud, in the long run.
