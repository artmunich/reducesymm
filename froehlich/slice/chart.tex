% \section{Charting the \reducedsp}
%       \label{sec:chart}


So far, the good news is that for a generic {\template}
$\slicep$ (\ie, any $\slicep$ whose group orbit has the full $N$-dimensions
of the group \Group), the
slice hyperplane \refeq{PCsectQ} cuts across the group orbit of {\em
every} point in the full \statesp\ \pS.

But is this a useful reduction of the \statesp? A distant pattern
that is a bad match to a given {\template} will have any number of
`minimal' distances, each another bad match.

I'm guided by \KS\ work with Lan, where \Poincare\ sections
are picked physically,
by neighborhoods of important solutions (2-rolls states, 3-rolls
states). The choice should be `physical,'
dictated by the dominant patterns seen in the solutions of
nonlinear PDEs.

Even though every generic
slice cuts all group orbits, it makes no sense physically to
use one slice
(a set of all group orbit points that are closest to a given {\template})
globally. Instead we should do what we
already do for \KS\ Poincar\'e sections. While \refref{Christiansen97} demonstrated
that \po\ theory can be applied to spatially extended systems, the
main advance of
\refref{lanCvit07} was to show that for more turbulent/chaotic systems a set
of Poincar\'e sections is needed to capture the dynamics.
A slice defined here is a purely group-theoretic, linear construct, with no reference
to dynamics; a given {\template} \slicep\ defines
the associated slice, a ($d\!-\!N$)-dimensional hyperplane.
Within it, there is a ($d\!-\!N\!-1$)-dimensional
singularity hyperplane
\[
\braket{\groupTan(\sspRed)}{\sliceTan{}}=0
\]
where the group tangent of a point
$\sspRed=\LieEl^{-1} \ssp$ lies in the slice. The singularity hyperplane
is also purely group-theoretical,
determined by the {\template} \slicep,
that pays no heed to nonlinear dynamics. If we pick another
slice-fixing point $\slicep'$, it comes along with its own slice
and singularity hyperplane. So idea is to coarsely cover the nonlinear
strange attractor with a set of hyperplanes, as in \reffig{fig:Tesselate}.
For any pair, they intersect in a 'boundary' hyperplane, of one less dimension.
So our task is to, for a given strange attractor, pick a set of slice-fixing
points, such that each is approximately tangent to the strange attractor,
and the singularity hyperplanes are eliminated by requiring that they
lie either on the `wrong' side of the slice-slice intersection, or somewhere where
the strange attractor does not tread.

{\bf Tessellation of the \reducedsp\ by two or many slices:
how to implement it?}
See \HREF{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram}
{wiki on Voronoi diagrams}.
We have to study Roweis  and Saul\rf{RoSa00}
\emph{``Nonlinear dimensionality reduction by locally linear embedding.''}
A sobering fact: Rowais, assistant professor at N.Y.U., a young
star in the field and universally liked, jumped out of his Washington
Square apartment earlier this year.
	}

Our proposal is to approximately
\HREF{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_tessellation} {Voronoi
tessellate}  the curved manifold in which the reduced strange attractor
is embedded by a finite set of hyperplanes\rf{RoSa00}, each a slice
tangential to one of a finite number of `reference states' or
{\template}. This tessellation is akin to the
\HREF{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_quantization}{`vector
quantization,'} (`block quantization,'  `pattern matching quantization'),
a computer science data compression method where sets of points are
clustered by their distance to `prototype' or `reference' points. The
method encodes values from a multidimensional vector space into a
`codebook,' a finite set of values from a discrete space of a lower
dimension; \ie, what in the theory of dynamical systems is called
`symbolic dynamics.'

So how do we propose to implement this tessellation?

An (affine) hyperplane is the locus of points obeying the equation:
\[
\sspRed_1\sliceTan{1} + \sspRed_2\sliceTan{2} + \cdots + \sspRed_d\sliceTan{d} = c
\,.
\]
\ie, $\braket{\sspRed}{\sliceTan{}}=c$. In the case of a slice
hyperplane, the extremal distance condition \refeq{PCsectQ0} sets $c=0$,
so all our slices include the point at the origin, $\sspRed=0$. A
$(d\!-\!1)$-dimensional hyperplane $\pSRed{}^{(j)}$ embedded in a
$d$-dimensional space and passing through the origin is defined by the
normal vector $\sliceTan{}{}^{(j)}$, a vector orthogonal to every vector
in the hyperplane (the tangent space \sliceTan{} is the primary object,
the {\template} \slicep\ secondary in this way of thinking). The
intersection of two $(d\!-\!1)$-dimensional hyperplanes is a
$(d\!-\!2)$-dimensional hyperplane - the `ridge' (`boundary,'  `edge'),
a hyperplane which also goes through the origin. If an ant is
crawling along the trajectory $\sspRed{}^{(1)}(\tau)$ symmetry-reduced
with respect to the first slice $\pSRed{}^{(1)}$, you do not need to
compute the precise location of this ridge. The moment
$\braket{\sspRed{}^{(1)}(\tau)}{\sliceTan{}{}^{(2)}}$ changes sign, the
ant has crossed the ridge, we symmetry-reduce with respect to the second
slice,
and the ant continues its merry stroll along the second slice
$\pSRed{}^{(2)}$. We
do not need to be very precise about the instant where we switch, as long
as we are away from either slice's singularity subspace.

There is a rub, though - you have to figure out how to pick the phases of
different {\template s} in such way that you
minimize the distance from one to the next as you cross the ridge.
The {\em relative phases} of different \reqva\ are fixed, and, as
proposed in \refref{SCD07}, the shortest heteroclinic connections
can provide the bridge from one neighborhood to the next.

We need to make a global chart by deploying both linear slices and linear
Poincar\'e sections in neighborhoods of the most important (relative)
equilibria and/or (relative) periodic orbits (those are tricky, because
slice fixing points must lie in the full \statesp, and have no symmetry,
so most of the solutions we have are not good as they stand). This is the
periodic-orbit generalization of the idea of

Boundaries
between hyperplanes are themselves hyperplanes of one dimension less and
should be easy compute once we have decided on the set of slices. To find
what slice a given full \statesp\ trajectory point is in, one group-rotates
with respect to each slice, and checks whether the given group orbit
belong to it. In the \reducedsp\ the trajectory is integrated within a
given slice until it hits a hyperplane boundary - then one switches to
the next slice across the boundary. This passage does not need to
be computed very precisely, as long as the singularity
hyperplanes are kept a safe distance away. Boundary corners are measure zero, no
way you would hit them.

Global chart should be sufficiently fine-grained that we never hit any
slice singularities. That means that the neighborhood - bounded by
intersections with neighboring slices is sufficiently small that group
tangent space is nowhere within the part of the slice explored by
the strange attractor - works for smooth flows
with sufficiently small neighborhoods.
