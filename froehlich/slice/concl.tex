Many physically important spatially extended and fluid dynamics systems exhibit continuous
symmetries. For example,  excitable
media\rf{ZaZha70,Winfree73,Winfree1980,BaKnTu90,Barkley94}, the \KS\
flow\rf{ku,siv,SCD07}, {\pCf}\rf{Visw07b,GHCW07,HGC08,GibsonMovies}, and
pipe flow\rf{Wk04,Kerswell05} are invariant (equivariant) under
combinations of translational (Euclidean), rotational and
discrete symmetries.
If a physical problem has a symmetry, one should use it - one does not
want to compute the same solution over and over, all one needs is to
pick one representative solution per each symmetry related equivalence
class. Such procedure is called symmetry reduction.  In this
paper we have investigated symmetry reduction by the \mslices,
a procedure particularly simple and practical to implement, and
answered affirmatively the two main questions about the method:
(1) does a slice cut the group orbit of \emph{every} point in the dynamical \statesp?
(2) can one deal with the {\sset s} that the method necessarily
introduce?

Re. (2) we have shown here that a reduced trajectory
passes through such singularities through computable jumps,
a nuisance numerically, but cause of no conceptual difficulty.

Re. (1): Locally, a slices intersect each group orbit in a neighborhood of a
{\template} only once,
but extended globally, a slice intersects a group orbit multiple times.
So even though every slice cuts all group orbits, it makes no sense
physically to use one slice (a set of all group orbit points that are
closest to a given {\template}) globally. Instead we propose to
construct make a global atlas by
deploying sets of slices and linear Poincar\'e sections as charts of
neighborhoods of the most important (relative) equilibria and/or
(relative) periodic orbits.

Ridges (intersection boundaries between different slices) are themselves
hyperplanes of lower dimensions, easy to compute once we have decided
on the set of slices. To find what slice a given full \statesp\
trajectory point is in, one rotates with respect to each slice, and
checks whether the given group orbit belongs to it. In the \reducedsp\
the trajectory is integrated within a given slice until it hits a ridge -
then one switches to the next slice across the boundary.
Global chart should be sufficiently fine-grained so that an unstable,
ergodic trajectory never gets too close to any of the {\sset s}. That
means that the neighborhood - bounded by intersections with neighboring
slices is sufficiently small that group tangent space is nowhere within
the slice - works in smooth flows for sufficiently small neighborhoods.

While we have demonstrated that the
\mslices\ works for a system as simple as the \cLf,
one still has to show that the method can be implemented for a
truly high-dimensional flow. The discrete symmetries that flows such as the
\KS\ and {\pCf} exhibit still have to be taken into account.
