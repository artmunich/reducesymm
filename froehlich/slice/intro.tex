%    \label{sec:intro}

In spatially extended turbulent flows (such as a pipe flow) one observes
similar patterns at different spatial positions and different times. 
How `similar?' If the dynamics of the system under study is invariant under
a group of continuous symmetries, one way of answering this question is by
measuring distances between different states in the
symmetry-reduced \statesp\ $\pS/\Group$, a space in which each group orbit (class
of physically equivalent states) is represented by a single point.
But there exist no preferred, one-size fits all
symmetry-reduction method. The literature
(see \refrefs{CBcontinuous,SiCvi10,SiminosThesis} for a review) broadly
offers two approaches (a) Hilbert invariant polynomial bases, and (b) methods which
slice group orbits, a generalization of the way that \Poincare\ sections cut
time-evolving trajectories.
%
Our goal is to find a computationally straightforward method of reducing the dynamics to a lower-dimensional \statesp, where each group orbit of the full system (\ie, set of rotationally equivalent states) is represented by a single point. If successful, the methods that we develop might be applicable to very high-dimensional flows, such as translationally equivariant fluid flows bounded by pipes or planes\rf{GHCW07,GibsonMovies}.
%
In this paper we argue that for 
high-dimensional chaotic/turbulent nonlinear flows the
\mslices\ is the only feasible implementable and practical technique.
In this context, the method has been
studied in \refrefs{SiminosThesis,SiCvi10,Wilczak09,CBcontinuous}.
Here the method is rederived as a distance minimization problem in the
space of patterns. The new results reported in this this paper are:
    (a) Any (linear) slice cuts across group orbits of {\em all} states in
        the \statesp.
    (b) Every slice carries along with it a {\sset}. We show how
        to compute the jump of the \reducedsp\ trajectory whenever it crosses
        through such singularity.
    (c) We propose to avoid these singularities (artifacts of the symmetry
        reduction by a linear slice) by tiling the \statesp\ by an atlas
        constructed from a set of local slices.
We also show that if a continuous symmetry has a product structure (such as
$\SOn(2) \times \SOn(2)$ symmetries of pipe and plane fluid flows), each
symmetry induces its own {\sset}.

\subsection{\CLe}
	
The \cLe\ were introduced by Gibbon and McGuinness\rf{GibMcCLE82}
as a low-dimensional model of baroclinic instability in the
atmosphere. 
In the real form,  the \cLe\ are a 5-dimensional first order ODE system
\beq
\begin{split}
	\dot{x}_1 &= -\sigma x_1 + \sigma y_1\\
	\dot{x}_2 &= -\sigma x_2 + \sigma y_2\\
	\dot{y}_1 &= (r_1-z) x_1 - r_2 x_2 -y_1-e y_2 \\
	\dot{y}_2 &= r_2 x_1 + (r_1-z) x_2 + e y_1- y_2\\
	\dot{z} &= -b z + x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2\,.
	\label{eq:CLeR}
\end{split}
\eeq
In all numerical calculations that follow we shall set the
parameters to Siminos thesis values\rf{SiminosThesis},
\beq
r_1=28,\; b=\frac{8}{3},\;
\sigma=10,\; e=\frac{1}{10},\quad \mbox{and} \quad r_2=0
\,.
\ee{SiminosPrmts}
Here we are not interested in the physical applications of these equations; rather, we use them as a simple example of a dynamical system with a continuous (but no discrete) symmetry.
The \cLe\ exhibit an $\SOn{2}$ symmetry under rotations around the z-axis, with
a finite angle \SOn{2} rotation given by
\beq
\LieEl(\gSpace) \,=\,  \left(\barr{ccccc}
  \cos \gSpace  & \sin \gSpace  & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 -\sin \gSpace  & \cos \gSpace  & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 &  \cos \gSpace & \sin \gSpace   & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & -\sin \gSpace & \cos \gSpace   & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0             & 0              & 1
    \earr\right)
\,,
\ee{CLfRots}
and the corresponding Lie algebra generator
\beq
 \Lg \,=\,   \left(\barr{ccccc}
    0  &  1 & 0  &  0 & 0  \\
   -1  &  0 & 0  &  0 & 0 \\
    0  &  0 & 0  &  1 & 0  \\
    0  &  0 &-1  &  0 & 0 \\
    0  &  0 & 0  &  0 & 0
    \earr\right)
\,.
\ee{CLfLieGen}
%From \refeq{SO2irrepAlg-m} we see that
The action of \SOn{2}\ on the \cLe\ \statesp\ thus decomposes into $m=0$ \Group-invariant subspace ($z$-axis) and  $m=1$ subspace with multiplicity 2.
The generator $\Lg$ is anti-hermitian,
$\Lg^\dagger = - \Lg$, and the group is compact, its
elements parameterized by $\gSpace \mbox{ mod } 2\pi$. Locally, at
$\ssp \in \pS$, the infinitesimal action of the group is
given by the group tangent field $\groupTan(\ssp) = \Lg \ssp
= (x_2,-x_1,y_2,-y_1,0)$. In other words, the flow induced by
the group action is normal to the radial direction in the
$(x_1,x_2)$ and $(y_1,y_2)$ planes, while the $z$-axis is left
invariant.
