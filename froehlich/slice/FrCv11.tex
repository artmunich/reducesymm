\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Suppose you are observing turbulence in a pipe flow, or your
defibrillator has a mesh of sensors measuring electrical currents that
cross your heart. Here you see a pattern, and there you see a pattern
that seems much like the first one. How ``much like the first one?'' Or
you have a precomputed pattern, and are sifting through the turbulent
data set for something like it. Think of the first pattern (represented
by a point {\slicep} in the \statesp) as a
`template'\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000,rowley_reduction_2003} or a
`reference state' and use the symmetries of the flow to slide and rotate
the `template' until it overlays the second pattern, \ie, act with elements of
the symmetry group \Group\ on the template \statesp\ point ${\slicep} \to
{\LieEl}{\slicep}$ until the distance between the two patterns, measured
in a bilinear norm of \refsect{def:innerProduct},
%    \PC{recheck, is the unitary case different,
%	(one does need $2 \Re \,\braket{\sspRed}{\slicep}$).
%	If so, restrict consideration to subgroups of \SOn{n}.}
\bea
|\ssp - {\LieEl}{\slicep}|^2
    &=& |\sspRed - \slicep|^2
		\,=\,
   \braket{\sspRed - \slicep}{\sspRed - \slicep}
%\\ |\ssp|^2 - 2\,\Re\braket{\sspRed}{\slicep} +|\slicep|^2
\,,
    \label{minDistance}
\eea
is minimized. Here $\sspRed$ is the point on the group orbit
of $\ssp$,
\beq
\ssp=\LieEl \sspRed
\,,
\ee{sspOrbit}
closest to the template. Rather than blindly sliding one pattern over the
other, we determine the group rotation `angles' $\gSpace =
(\gSpace_1,\gSpace_2,\cdots\gSpace_N)$ by solving the extremum condition
	\PC{to select minima, need 2nd partials}
\bea
0 &=&
\frac{\partial ~~}{\partial \gSpace_a} |\ssp - \LieEl\slicep|^2
	\continue
  &=& \braket{\sspRed - \slicep}{\sliceTan{a}}
    \,,\qquad
	  \sliceTan{a} = \Lg_a \slicep
\,,
\label{PCsectQ}
\eea
where $\ssp \in \pS$ is a point in the full \statesp, and  the group
elements \refeq{FiniteRot} of Lie group $\Group$ are represented  by
$\LieEl=\exp(\gSpace \cdot \Lg)$.
By the antihermiticity of $\Lg$, \refeq{antiHerm},  we have
$\braket{\slicep}{\sliceTan{a}}=0$, and the transformation parameters
$\gSpace$ for which the state $\ssp$ is closest to the template
$\slicep$ are fixed by $N$ slice conditions
\beq
\braket{\sspRed}{\sliceTan{a}} =0
    \,,\qquad
\sspRed = \LieEl(\gSpace) \ssp
\,.
\ee{PCsectQ0}

A given compact group orbit intersects a slice at least twice, and
possibly many times, so we need a prescription for how to
pick a unique \reducedsp\ point as the representative of the entire group
orbit.

The extremal distance condition \refeq{PCsectQ1} is a condition that
closest point $\sspRed$ in the group orbit of $\ssp$ lies in a
$(d\!-\!N)$-dimensional hyperplane normal to the group action tangent
space $\sliceTan{}$ at template point $\slicep$. If the two patterns are
close, their group orbits will be nearly parallel, and for a smooth flow
this tangent plane will be transverse to all group orbits of $\ssp$ in a
neighborhood of \slicep.

However, we will be bolder, and show next that for a generic template $\slicep$ (\ie, any $\slicep$ whose group orbit is $N$-dimensional), the slice hyperplane \refeq{PCsectQ1} cuts across the group orbit of {\em every} point in the full \statesp\ \pS.

    \PC{reuse this somewhere: "
If $\ssp$ is the invariant subspace \refeq{def:centralizer}, its group
orbit is itself and the distance $|\sspRed - \slicep|$ is fixed.
    "}

As a generic group orbit is a curved $N$-dimensional manifold embedded in
the \statesp, several values of $\gSpace$ might be local extrema of the
distance function \refeq{minDistance}; we only care about those that are
local {\em minima}, for which all the eigenvalues of tensor
\refeq{PCinflPoint} are positive. The physically most interesting one is
presumably the closest one, the absolute minimum of \refeq{minDistance}.
It does not matter whether the group is compact, for example $\On{n}$, or
noncompact, for example the Euclidean group that underlies the generation
of spiral patterns\rf{Barkley94}; in either case any group orbit has
one or several locally closest passages to the template state.
    \PC{recycle this:
Here we describe symmetry reduction by the
{\em {\mslices}} of
Cartan\rf{CartanMF,FelsOlver98,FelsOlver99,OlverInv}.
    }

For
example, group orbits of \SOn{2}\ are topologically circles, and their
projections have maxima, minima and inflection points as extrema.
In order to ensure that we are looking at local minima, we will have to
check the local curvature, \ie, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
symmetric matrix $[N\!\times\!N]$ matrix of second derivatives
of distance,
\beq
\frac{\partial^2}
     {\partial \gSpace_a \partial \gSpace_b}
        |\sspRed - \slicep|^2
    =
%  - \braket{\Lg_a e^{\gSpace \cdot \Lg} \ssp}{\sliceTan{b}}=
  - \braket{\groupTan_a(\sspRed)}{\sliceTan{b}}=
  \braket{\sspRed}{\dual{\Lg}{}_a {\Lg}{}_b\slicep}
\ee{PCinflPoint}


The distance surface $|\sspRed - \slicep|$ can have inflection points,
What role do they play? They are non-generic, but if we consider distance
to local minima at successive instants of a time-evolving trajectory,
coalescence of
nearby minima, maxima pairs cannot be avoided. At the instant of
coalescence the denominator in \refeq{SF:sliceEas} goes through a simple
pole, and the integrated trajectory within slice might jump.
