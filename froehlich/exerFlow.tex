\exercise{\Eqva\ of \cLe:}{\label{exer:EquiCLe}
Find all \eqva\ of \cLe.
    }

\solution{exer:EquiCLe}{\Eqva\ of \cLe.}{
Either the {\eqv} point is in $Fix(G)$ or it is not.

If it is in $Fix(G)$, then it is on the $z$-axis so we have $x_1 = x_2 = y_1 = y_2 = 0$. These values already give us $\dot{x}_1 = \dot{x}_2 = \dot{y}_1 = \dot{y}_2 = 0$, so we only need to check when $\dot{z} = 0$. This happens when $x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 - b z = - b z = 0$, so $z = 0$, and the origin is an {\eqv} point.

If an {\eqv} point is not in $Fix(G)$ then by the $SO(2)$ equivariance of the equations, there exists a corresponding {\eqv} point with $x_1 = 0$. The equations $\dot{x}_1 = 0$ and $\dot{x}_2 = 0$ then give us that $y_1 = x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = y_2$ (assuming $\sigma$ is nonzero). Next, look at $\dot{y}_1 = -r_2 x_2 - e y_2 = 0$. If $x_2 = 0$ then we must also have $y_2 = 0$ and we are then on the z-axis and in $Fix(G)$. So we can assume $x_2$ is nonzero. We then have $- r_2 x_2 - e y_2 = 0$, $x_2 = y_2$ nonzero so we can divide through by $-x_2$ and get $r_2 + e = 0$. So in order for there to be an {\eqv} point other than the origin, we must have $e + r_2 = 0$. Looking at $\dot{y}_2 = 0$ we get that $y_2 / x_2 = r_1 - z$, so $z = r_1 - 1$. Finally, $\dot{z} = x_2 y_2 - b z = 0$, so $x_2 y_2 = b (r_1 - 1)$, and $x_2^2 = b (r_1 - 1)$. A solution to this will exist only if $r_1 > 1$.

Assuming $\sigma$ nonzero (Note: if $\sigma = 0$ then x is constant and the system is now linear), we therefore find that the origin is always an {\eqv} point, and it will be the only {\eqv} point unless $e + r_2 = 0$ and $r_1 > 1$. In this case, the system has the additional {\eqv} points $(0, \pm \sqrt{b (r_1 - 1)}, 0, \pm \sqrt{b (r_1 - 1)}, r_1 - 1)$ and all the points in their group orbits.

The Ning and Haken\rf{NingHakenCLE90} version of \cLe\
(a
truncation of Maxwell-Bloch equations describing a single
mode ring laser) sets $e+\ImrCLor=0$ so that a detuned
\eqv\ exists. Test your routines on 2 cases: (a)  $e=0$, $\ImrCLor=0$.
As discussed by Siminos\rf{SiminosThesis}, reality of
parameters $a$, $\rho$ in \refeq{eq:CLe} implies existence of
a discrete \Ztwo\ symmetry. (b) $e+\ImrCLor=0$, $e \neq 0$.

The alternate solution to the previous exercise showed that the origin was the only {\eqv} point, unless $e + r_2 = 0$. In this case if $r_1 > 1$ then the points $(0, +/- \sqrt{b (r_1 - 1)},0, +/- \sqrt{b (r_1 - 1)}, r_1 - 1)$ and all the points in their group orbits are also {\eqv} points.

         The system is equivariant under infinitesimal angles if its Lie derivative is zero, i.e.

\section{\Reqva}

\solution{exer:PlotRelEqu}{\Reqv\ $\REQB{1}$ in Cartesian coordinates.}{
\authorSF{Jun 4 2010}

\exercise{Computing the \reqv\ $\REQB{1}$:}{\label{exer:CompRelEqu}
Find the \reqva\ of the \cLe\ by finding the \eqva\ of the
system in polar coordinates \refeq{eq:PolarCLeTheta}.
Compute the velocity of such \reqv.
}

A relative {\eqv} point occurs when the derivatives
\refeq{eq:PolarCLeTheta} are equal to zero (so that the
difference between the two angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$
is constant, but the angles themselves are not constant).
This gives us the set of equations:

\beq
\begin{split}
 -\sigma\left(\rho_1 - \rho_2\cos\theta\right)=0 \\
 -\rho_2 + (r_1-z)\rho_1\cos \theta=0\\
  -e -\left(\sigma\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1}
 +(r_1-z)\frac{\rho_1}{\rho_2}\right)\sin\theta=0\\
 -b z + \rho_1\rho_2\cos\theta=0
\end{split}
\label{eq:E1}
\eeq

The first and second equations give us that $\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1}=\frac{1}{\cos \theta}$ and $\left(r_1-z\right)=\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1 \cos \theta}$. Plugging these into the third equation we have $0=-e-\left(\frac{\sigma}{\cos \theta}+\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1 \cos \theta} \frac{\rho_1}{\rho_2}\right) \sin \theta$, so $-\frac{e}{\sigma +1}=\tan \theta$.
This means $\cos \theta = \pm \sqrt \frac{1}{d}$ where $d = 1+\frac{e^2}{\left(\sigma +1\right)^2}$. If $e$ and $\sigma$ are both positive, then $\tan \theta < 0$ so  $\theta$ must be either between$\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\pi$ or between $0$ and $-\frac{\pi}{2}$.

Again using the first and second equations we get that $\frac{\rho_1}{\rho_2} \frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1} = \cos \theta \left(r_1 - z\right) \cos \theta$ so $1=\left(r_1 -z\right) \cos ^2 \theta$ so $z=r_1 -d$.
Using the first and fourth equations we have that $b z = \rho_1 ^2$, so $\rho_1 = \pm \sqrt{b\left(r_1 -d\right)}$.
And finally, by the first equation and the value for $\rho_1$ we get that $\rho_2 = \pm \sqrt{b d\left(r_1 -d)\right)}$, where $sign\left(\rho_1\right) = sign\left(\rho_2\right) sign\left(\cos \theta\right)$.

Let $\theta_Q$ be the angle between $0$ and $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ such that $\cos \theta_Q = \sqrt \frac{1}{d}$. Note that the angle for when $\cos \theta = - \sqrt \frac{1}{d}$ is then just $\theta_Q +\pi$.
So the \reqva for \cLe in polar coordinates are then $\left(\pm \sqrt{b \left(r_1 -d\right)},\pm \sqrt{b d \left(r_1 -d\right)},\theta_Q, r_1 -d\right)$ and $\left(\pm \sqrt{b \left(r_1 -d\right)},\mp \sqrt{b d \left(r_1 -d\right)},\theta_Q +\pi, r_1 -d \right)$. The solutions of the first pair are actually the same point since having a negative radius is the same as rotating by $\pi$ in polar coordinates, so when both of the radii are negative you can just rotate $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ by $\pi$ to make the radii positive again while leaving $\theta$ unchanged since both angles where rotated by the same amount. The same argument holds for both of the solutions in the second pair being the same. The first pair of solutions is equivalent to the second pair of solutions since for the second pair, this time rotate one of the angles; this causes its sign to reverse and only one of the angles to change by $\pi$ so $\theta$ is changed by $\pi$. So there is only one relative equilibrium solution, $\left(\sqrt{b \left(r_1 -d\right)},\sqrt{b d \left(r_1 -d\right)},\theta_Q, r_1 -d\right)$.


The solutions differ by combinations of negative and positive
$\rho_1,\ \rho_2,\ \theta$. A negative $\rho_i$ solution
corresponds to the same group orbit of solutions, related to
the positive $\rho_i$ solution by a rotation by $\pi$. The
$\rho_1 \geq 0 \,,\rho_2 \geq 0$ condition in
\refeq{eq:CartToPol} reduces these solutions to two,
differing by the sign of $\cos ^{-1}$ term. Defining $d=1 +
{e^2}/{(\sigma +1)^2}$, we can write them compactly
as\rf{SiminosThesis}
\beq
(\rho_1,\rho_2,\theta,z) =
\left(\sqrt{b \,(r_1-d)},\sqrt{b d \,({r_1}-d}),
      \pm \cos^{-1}\left({1}/{\sqrt{d}}\right),
      r_1-d\right)

The spiral-out instability appears very slow, but with a
short period $\period{spiral}=0.6163$, about 112 turns for one
period of the $\REQB{1}$. Actually, as the \reqv\ velocity
\refeq{eq:REQB1veloc} is slow, an initial deviation from
$\ssp_{\REQB{}1}$ is multiplied by the factor
$\ExpaEig_{radial}=535$, and the \reqv\ is quite unstable.
This is illustrated by \reffig{fig:CLERelEqui}\,(b). It would
be sweet if we could eliminate the detuning drift time scale
$\approx 70$ and focus just on the oscillatory time scale of
$\approx 0.6$. That is one of the motivations for
reformulating dynamics in a \reducedsp.

\section{\Reducedsp}

\exercise{\Statesp\ reduction by a \slice, finite time segments:}
{\label{exer:csectionCLe}
Replace integration of the \cLe\ by a sequence of short time steps,
each followed by a rotation such that the next segment initial point
is in the {\slice} $x_2=0,\,x_1>0$.
    }

\solution{exer:csectionCLe}{\Statesp\ reduction by a \slice.}{
We start by setting the initial point and the time step that
will be used during the integration. Using
\texttt{Mathematica}, we first remove the $z$ component of
the initial point so that we have $x(0)-x(0) \cdot
\hat{z}=\{x_1(0),x_2(0),y_1(0),y_2(0),0\}$. In order to
rotate each of the points, we must construct a matrix
\beq
\begin{split}
\mathbb{G}=
\left(
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\cos(\theta) & \sin(\theta) & 0 & 0 & 0\\
-\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & \cos(\theta) & \sin(\theta) & 0\\
0 & 0 & -\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}
\right)
\end{split}
\eeq
where $\theta$ is the angle between the new point (minus the
$z$ component) and the positive $x_1$ axis ($\hat{x_1}=\{1,
0, 0, 0, 0\}$). From \refexer{exer:FinRotInvarCmplx}, we know
that the \cLe\ are invariant for this kind of rotation, so
that when we reduce the \cLf\ it contains the same
information as the 5-dimensional system. We do not need to
determine the angles themselves, we need only their cosines
and sines. The cosine is found by a dot product as:
\beq
\cos(\theta)=\frac{x \cdot \hat{x}_1}{\lvert x \rvert}
\,
\eeq
Sines can be found by rotating each point by $\frac{\pi}{2}$
and then taking the dot product as with cosine. Taking the
first point, we first rotate it with $\mathbb{G}$, and
starting with this rotated point, we integrate over the
defined time step. We then take the last point from the
integration, find its $\mathbb{G}$ and rotate it, then use it
at the beginning of the next integration from $t=timestep$ to
$t=2 \cdot timestep$. This process continues (using a
\texttt{For} loop in \texttt{Mathematica}) until the end of
the integration (at an arbitrary time). The resulting list of
rotated points is then plotted. Using this method, we
produced \reffig{fig:CLEUnrotated}\,(a) and
\reffig{fig:CLEUnrotated}\,(b).
    \ES{It would be
very instructive to also include the $\{x_1, y_1, z\}$ plot and
increase the integration time to $t=200$ to discover that you
still have to deal with a two eared attractor. Do you get any kink? }

A very long time ($t=5000$) simulation of \cLf, plot of
$\{x_1,x_2\}$  neighborhood in \reffig{fig:CLEsmall-x1x2},
indicates that probability of hitting $(x_1,x_2) =(0,0)$ is

$\rho_1(t)=\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2} > 0.02$. Plots of $\{y_1,y_2\}$
neighborhood look similar.
Hence reduction of \statesp\ to 4-dimensional $x_2=0$ \reducedsp\ by rotating successive trajectory increments back
to the $x_1>0$ semi-axis should not run into an $x_1 =0$
singularity in determining the rotation angle $\cos\theta$.
\ES{I certainly agree with this and I think it is clear in
section 4.1.4.2 of the \emph{thesis no one wants to read} that
the singularity of the transformations does not pose a problem
for reduction in the case of \cLe\ as we do not encounter it
numerically (I've tried to pay the extra price and produce a proof
that the denominator cannot vanish but failed).
The reason that the singularity is annoying for me (beyond
visualization problems) is that in the \KS\ case dynamics goes
through zeros in the denominator.}

Infinitesimal time version of the moving frames
symmetry reduction is attained by taking small time steps
in \reffig{fig:PCunrot} and dropping the higher order terms,
as in \refsect{sect:SymmDyn}:
\[
d\ssp^{(n)} = d t \, v(\ssp^{(n)})
                    + d \theta_1^{(n)} \, \Lg \cdot \ssp^{(n)}

The infinitesimal angle is proportional to the time step,
\[
\theta_1^{(n)} \approx \sin \theta_1^{(n)}
             = - d t \, \frac{\hat{{\bf e}}_{1} \cdot v(\ssp^{(n)})}

where $(\rho_1,\theta_1)$ are polar coordinates,
$\rho_1 = \sqrt{\ssp_1^{ 2} + \ssp_2^{2}}$,
see \refeq{eq:CartToPol}. Our \slice\ condition is $x_1=0,\;x_2>0$,
so the \reducedsp\ equations are given by
\beq
\dot{\ssp} = v - \frac{v_1}{\ssp_2} \Lg \cdot \ssp
\,.
\ee{ExerMotionMovFrame}
The motion stays in the $(d\!-\!1)$-\slice, as $\dot{\ssp}_1 = 0$ due to
the orthogonal action of $\Lg$ to the direction $\ssp$.

Moving frames symmetry reduced \cLe\ are a 4-dimensional
first order ODE system
\beq
\begin{split}
	\dot{x}_2 &= -\sigma  (x_2 - y_2) \\
	\dot{y}_1 &= - y_1 + r_2 x_2 - \left(e + {\sigma y_1}/{x_2}\right) y_2\\
	\dot{y}_2 &=  - y_2 + (r_1-z) x_2 + \left(e + {\sigma y_1}/{x_2}\right) y_1 \\
	\dot{z}\; &= -b z + x_2 y_2
\,.
\end{split}

The resulting trajectory is illustrated in
\reffig{fig:PCunrot1}. It agrees with trajectories reported
by Siminos (there the simulation is in the full \statesp, and
the \reducedsp\ dynamics is obtained by a coordinate change).
\ES{\refeq{eq:rdcdCLeR} follows from
\cLe\ expressed in the invariant coordinates obtained by the moving frame
method. Since this blog is not explicit transformation
friendly I've added this calculation in my thesis (sec. 4.1.4).
({\bf PC:} I fixed the errors in my rewrite - we agree).
We have done the same
for ZM system long time ago when we heuristically
rederived Cartan's method. It has been moved to a footnote in Jonathan's
blog (eq. 5.37) and became one the things that never found their way back to my thesis.
({\bf PC:} I never understood why ZM system was junked {\bf ES:} We've agreed to
junk it when we realized it has no relative equilibria. Also see Sec. 4.1 of my thesis.).
One also gets the same system by using invariant
polynomials and taking the syzygy into account, see discussion preceding 5.46 in
Jonathan's blog. {\bf PC:} please write this up in your thesis - will need it for
the planned publication.}

\noindent
- Checked that it agrees with finite step + rotation of \reffig{fig:PCunrot}\\
- $x_2$ and $y_2$ seem locked, oscillate the same way with amplitude up to 20\\
- $y_1$ is very small, mostly below 0.1\\
- $( x_2 , y_2 ,z)$ plot looks discontinuous in $y_2$ whenever $x_2$ small,
across the $z$-axis (indicated in red).

this subspace very, with \reducedsp\ velocity going off to infinity.

Let $t'$ be a vector normal to the plane of the slice. Then the dynamics within the slice are given by the equations:
\beq
\dot \theta\left(y\right) = \frac{v\left(y\right)\cdot t'}{T y \cdot t'} \cont
u\left(y\right)=v\left(y\right)-\theta\left(y\right) T y
\eeq
where $u\left(y\right)$ is the velocity in the slice.

This gives us
\beq 
    \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial y_j} = \frac{\partial v_i\left(y\right)}{\partial y_j}-\frac{\partial \dot    \theta\left(y\right)}{\partial y_j} \left(T y\right)_i - \dot \theta\left(y\right)\frac{\partial \left(T y\right)_i}{\partial y_j}

\beq

\beq
    \frac{\partial \left(T y\right)_i}{\partial y_j} = T_{ij}

Now, using the fact that $\frac{\partial v_i}{\partial y_j} = A_{ij}$, where $A$ is the stability matrix of the flow in normal \Statesp, and that $v\left(y\right) = c T y$ for relative equilibrium, we get the equation
\beq
