I have incorporated your corrections into the text. I sent two files:
* nameless.tex is the normal one, for the course webpage.
* in nameless-edit.tex the additions are highlighted in blue color and I have
added footnotes with some of your comments that I would like to discuss as well
as my thoughts (they are put in the bibliography).

Regarding the title, there was a title page in the last version and is also
there in the web. Do you mean that I should change the title?

Regards,

Evangelos
