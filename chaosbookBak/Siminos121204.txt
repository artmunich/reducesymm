There are two forms of the report:
nameless-edit.tex with comments that I have included at the begining of the
semester in blue font.
nameless-www.tex for the web page.
In both editions there is a new section devoted to the variational method.

The main program is in FD.f90. It looks very messy since it is in the proccess
of debug. Some of the subroutines are from Numerical Recipies so I don't know
if it is a good idea to upload them in the web. Those are:
banmul
banbks
bandec
lubksb
ludcmp
nr
nrtype
nrutil

Please let me know if something does not work with the files.

Regards,

Evangelos
