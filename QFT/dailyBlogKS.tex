\chapter{Kamal's Gribov term paper}
\label{c-dailyBlogKS}

\begin{description}
\item[2013-11-25  Predrag to Kamal] Created this for you to blog
your QFT final paper.

\item[2013-10-12  Kamal] I will be away during the month of January for my wedding.
I will be working from home and updating through GitHub.
Please let me know if you have anything you want me to take care of.
Further, it will be great for me if you could send me the material
for the QFT final project. As you might have experienced, speed is
an issue with my working on new stuff so I want to start as early
as possible to get something useful out of it given the time constraints.
Also the TA duties are killing me. I am working on it and want to be productive fast.

\item[2013-10-17 Predrag to Kamal] I was thinking that it might be useful
to learn about the \emph{`Gribov ambiguity'}. My notes are in
\refchap{c-Gribov}. Have a look... The posts there summarize all my notes
about the \emph{`Gribov ambiguity'}. I fear it is too difficult, starting
with your current background in QFT, but it is one of directions in which
our current symmetry-reduction work might develop in the future...

So, instead of the final exam in the Quantum Field Theory Course, please
some of the references I have listed (or, better still, find more accessible
references by web searches) and write up here, as you learn, about 10-15
pages of what you have learned. The delivery deadline is
