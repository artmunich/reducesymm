Phil Morrison told me that Birkhoff discovered $G-2$ while looking for
hidden symmetries of the heat kernel. Did not find the reference (it is
in his thin book on statistical mechanics?) but this is of interest:

Ilka Agricola\rf{Agricola08} writes:
``
In a talk delivered in Leipzig on June 11, 1900, Friedrich
Engel\rf{Engel1900} gave the first public account of his newly discovered
description of the smallest exceptional Lie group $G_2$, and he wrote in
the corresponding note to the Royal Saxonian Academy of Sciences:
Moreover, we hereby obtain a direct definition of our 14-dimensional
simple group $G_2$ which is as elegant as one can wish for. Indeed,
Engel's definition of $G_2$ as the isotropy group of a generic 3-form in
7 dimensions is at the basis of a rich geometry that exists only on
7-dimensional manifolds,
''

This is precisely how I think of $G_2$, so should give Engel and
Reichel credit, and
cite Agricola\rf{Agricola08}.

One immediately discovers that Baez and Huerta\rf{BaeHue14} think of
$G_2$ as a small ball rolling on a big ball, and so on; with this one can
be infinitely distracted.
