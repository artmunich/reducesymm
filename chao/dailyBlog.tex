\item[Chao's Rules] On my
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/~predrag/courses/PHYS-6124-10/RenminRibao.doc}
{Mao's boyscout honor} I pledge to add a substantial update on my
progress here at least twice a week, work incrementally and steadily on
drafts of my papers, and attend all physics colloquia, nonlinear physics,
math seminars, study groups, or my name be spelled the Italian way.
	\PC{the worry? Last blog entry is about Apr 19, today is July 18.
	``At least twice a week?''
		}

\item[2011-07-20 PC + CS] The above agreement has been solemnly signed
by Predrag and Chao, for the period starting after completing the qualifiers
Aug 22, and to Dec 31 2011.

Revolution is not a dinner party, not an essay, nor a painting, nor a
piece of embroidery. \HREF{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS3QOtbW4m0}
{The revolution will not be televised}, will not be televised, will
not be televised, will not be televised. The revolution will be no re-run
brothers; \HREF{http://www.gilscottheron.com/lyrevol.html}{The
revolution will be live.}

\item[2011-03-16 PC] Chao, please keep track of what goes on in
siminos/blog/ and siminos/lyapunov/ - you will be getting emails about
updates. There is some current excitement there concerning the `physical'
dimensionality of the \KS\ strange attractors.

\item[2011-03-17 CS to Ruslan, Stefan and Evangelos]
   Hi! Nice to meet you all. It is the first time I type something here.
   I am still reading Chapter 4. (and \rf{EllGaHoRa09}) I will catch up with
   you as soon as I can. Maybe I will have a lot of questions to consult
   you. Hope you won't bother:)

\item[2011-03-16 PC] Why reference to Ellis, Gay-Balmaz, Holm
                  and Ratiu\rf{EllGaHoRa09}?

\item[2011-03-22 PC to Chao]
This might be of interest to Adam, let him know about it:
\HREF{http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3981}{arXiv:1103.3981},
\emph{Chains of rotational tori and filamentary structures close to high
 multiplicity periodic orbits in a 3D galactic potential},
 by Katsanikas, Patsis and Pinotsis.

They write
``
This paper discusses phase space structures encountered in the neighborhood of periodic orbits with high order multiplicity in a 3D autonomous Hamiltonian system with a potential of galactic type. We consider 4D spaces of section and we use the method of color and rotation [Patsis and Zachilas 1994] in order to visualize them. As examples we use the case of two orbits, one 2-periodic and one 7-periodic. We investigate the structure of multiple tori around them in the 4D surface of section and in addition we study the orbital behavior in the neighborhood of the corresponding simple unstable periodic orbits. By considering initially a few consequents in the neighborhood of the orbits in both cases we find a structure in the space of section, which is in direct correspondence with what is observed in a resonance zone of a 2D autonomous Hamiltonian system. However, in our 3D case we have instead of stability islands rotational tori, while the chaotic zone connecting the points of the unstable periodic orbit is replaced by filaments extending in 4D following a smooth color variation. For more intersections, the consequents of the orbit which started in the neighborhood of the unstable periodic orbit, diffuse in phase space and form a cloud that occupies a large volume surrounding the region containing the rotational tori. In this cloud the colors of the points are mixed. The same structures have been observed in the neighborhood of all m-periodic orbits we have examined in the system. This indicates a generic behavior.

What do you mean by "take the Hall out of library"?:) I actually don't understand your last email.

\item[2011-03-25 PC]
Reference to Hall is in the {\em Lie police} section of Siminos
blog. It is good idea to keep reading updates of the three blogs - yours,
siminos/blog and siminos/lyapunov, they are all related to your work.

\item[2011-03-31 PC] Just curious (it's your blog, you do what you want with it):
    why did you undo the \texttt{svn-multi}? The reason why I
    installed it is that when you print paper copies of the blog
    it keeps track of the svn version, date of last edit of a given
    file. This is very useful when you have bunch of handwritten edits
    of earlier versions that you would like to keep track of.
    Evangelos has problems with system managers in France, so he
    introduced the switch \texttt{$\setminus$svnmultifalse}, which
    you can also comment out in blog.tex. But I think there should
    be no problem, so I have reverted to the version prior to your commenting out
    \texttt{svn-multi} lines.

\item[2011-03-31 CS] Sorry about that. I undo the \texttt{svn-multi}
because otherwise I can not compile the .tex file and generate pdf
document. I have not yet find another way to reconcile the
\texttt{svn-multi}. Before that I can make two versions, one with
\texttt{svn-multi} commented kept for my own use and one the same with
this for your convenience.

\item[2011-04-06 PC] Here is my configuration of \texttt{WinEdt}
(but that is a matter of taste)

\begin{verbatim}
[x] MikTeX 4.9 full distribution installation
[x] WinEdt, see www.cns.gatech.edu/CNS-only/WinEdt.txt
	configuration wizard, wrapping:
        [ ] disable wrapping
		[ ] remove TeX; from Conventional (Soft) Wrapping
		[ ] fixed right margin 74
		[ ] disable indent soft wrapping
	in preferences, disable
		[ ] Wrap Mode, and [ ] Line Wrapping Enabled
\end{verbatim}

In order to read \texttt{siminos/blog} you need to \texttt{LaTeX},
then \texttt{dvi -> ps} and then either read the \texttt{ps} file, or
convert \texttt{ps -> pdf}. This requires that you install these:

\begin{verbatim}
[ ] www.ghostscript.com
    [ ] gs901w32 -> C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.01\bin\gswin32.exe
[ ] ghostview pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/
    manually changed 'execution modes' to
    [ ] C:\Program Files\Ghostgum\gsview\gsview32.exe
\end{verbatim}

\item[2011-04-19 CS]
BTW, any recommendation for a hands on book for Lie group and Lie
algebra? I think I need a deeper knowledge about this.

\item[2011-04-20 PC] I suggested in the siminos/blog/ (please keep reading it)
that you check out a book from the library that Meiss recommends. Do it, see
whether it eases the pain. You can also get
Gilmore and Letellier\rf{GL-Gil07b}
{\em The Symmetry of Chaos} out of the CNS library. It only does the
invariant polynomial reduction (Siminos and I believe that is useless in
higher dimensions), but it is pretty good on discrete symmetries.
