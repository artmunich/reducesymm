\item[2011-03-16 PC to Ruslan, Stefan and Evangelos]
   Chao Shi shichao116@gmail.com is starting ( rather late) to work on
   slicing and dicing Kuramoto Sivashinsky as a 1st year graduate student
   project. Hopefully we can get him to speed with your and Stefan's help
   within the next six months. At the moment he is reading parts of
   ChaosBook and our articles, but it might be wise that you teach him
   immediately how to use your KS programs and data, so we do not waste
   time on that. Chao can compute.

\item[2011-03-16 PC] Chao, please keep track of what goes on in
siminos/blog/ and siminos/lyapunov/ - you will be getting emails about
updates. There is some current excitement there concerning the `physical'
dimensionality of the \KS\ strange attractors.

\item[2011-03-16 CS]
I am currently reading
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/paper.shtml\#stability}
{ChaosBook Chapter 4 ``Local stability''},
and here are my notes / observations / questions to discus.

From ChaosBook.org:
\beq
{d \over dt} \deltaX(\xInit,t) =
{\Mvar}(\ssp) \,  \deltaX(\xInit,t)
	\,,\qquad \ssp=\ssp(\xInit,t)
\, .
\label{lin_odes}
\eeq

\beq
{\Mvar}_{ij}(\ssp) ={\pde \vel_i(\ssp)\over \pde \ssp_j  }
\ee{DerMatrix}
\beq
    \deltaX(t) = \jMps^t(\xInit) \deltaX_0
    \,, \qquad
\jMps^t_{ij}(\xInit)
  =  \left. {\pde \ssp_i(t) \over \pde \ssp_j} \right|_{\ssp=\xInit}
\, .
\label{hOdes}
\eeq
The Jacobian matrix $\jMps$ is sometimes referred to as the
{\em fundamental solution matrix} or simply
{\em fundamental matrix}, a name inherited
from the theory of linear ODEs.
It is also sometimes called the {\em Fr\'echet derivative} of the
nonlinear mapping $\flow{t}{\ssp}$. It is often denoted $Df$, but
for our needs (we shall have to sort through a plethora of
related \jacobianMs) matrix notation $\jMps$ is more
economical. $\jMps$ describes the deformation of an
infinitesimal neighborhood at
finite time $t$ in the co-moving frame of $\ssp(t)$. %,
\beq
 \jMps^t(\ssp_\stagn) = e^{{\Mvar}_\stagn t}
    \,,\qquad
 {\Mvar}_\stagn={\Mvar}(\ssp_\stagn)
\,.
\ee{eqPointStab}

\item[2011-03-16 PC] From ChaosBook.org: ``
The nomenclature tends to be a bit confusing.
In referring to \velgradmat) ${\Mvar}$ defined in \refeq{DerMatrix}
as the {``\stabmat''} we follow Tabor\rf{Tabor89}.
												\toCB
All too often ${\Mvar}$,
which describes the instantaneous shear of the trajectory
point $\ssp(\xInit,t)$ is referred to as the `Jacobian
matrix,'
a particularly unfortunate usage when one considers
linearized stability of an \eqv\ point \refeq{eqPointStab}.
What Jacobi had in mind in his
1841 fundamental paper\rf{Jacobi1841} on the determinants today known as
`jacobians' were transformations between different coordinate frames,
\ie, in the present context, the
$\jMps^{t} = e^{t {\Mvar}}$ transformation of the local linearized
neighborhood.
These are dimensionless quantities,
while dim\-ens\-ion\-ally ${\Mvar}_{ij}$ is 1/[time].
More unfortunate still is referring to
$\jMps^{t} = e^{t {\Mvar}}$ as an `evolution operator,' which here
% (see \refsect{s_aver_ev_op})
refers to something altogether different.
In this book
\jacobianM\ $\jMps^{t}$ always refers to
\refeq{hOdes},
the linearized deformation after a finite time $t$, either for a
continuous time flow, or a discrete time mapping.
''

												\toCB
Additional notes:
Manos \etal\rf{MaSkAn11} refer to \refeq{lin_odes}
as the ``variational equations'' and
$\Mvar$ in \refeq{DerMatrix} as ``the Jacobian matrix'' of  $\vel$.
