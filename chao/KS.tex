Recent experimental and theoretical advances\rf{science04}
support a dynamical vision of turbulence:
For any finite  spatial resolution,
a turbulent flow follows approximately for a finite time
a pattern belonging to a
{ finite alphabet}
of admissible patterns.
The long term dynamics is
a {walk through the space of these unstable patterns}.
The question is how to characterize and classify such patterns?
Here we follow the seminal Hopf paper\rf{hopf48}, and  visualize
turbulence not as  a sequence of
spatial snapshots in turbulent evolution,
but as a trajectory in an
 $\infty$-$d$ \statesp\ in which an
instant in turbulent evolution is
a {unique} point. In the dynamical systems approach,
theory of turbulence for a given system, with given boundary conditions,
is given by
(a) the geometry of the \statesp\ and (b) the associated natural measure,
\ie,
the likelihood that asymptotic dynamics visits a given \statesp\ region.

We pursue this program in context of the \KS\ (KS) equation,
one of the simplest physically interesting spatially extended
nonlinear systems.  Holmes, Lumley and Berkooz\rf{Holmes96} offer a
delightful discussion of why this system deserves study as a staging
ground for studying turbulence in full-fledged Navier-Stokes
boundary shear flows.

{
Flows described by partial differential equations (PDEs) are
said to be infinite dimensional because if one writes them
down as a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), a set
of infinitely many ODEs is needed to represent the dynamics
of one PDE. Even though their {\statesp} is thus
$\infty$-dimensional, the long-\-time dynamics of viscous
flows, such as Navier-Stokes, and PDEs modeling them, such as
\KS, exhibits, when dissipation is high and
the system spatial extent small, apparent `low-dimensional'
dynamical behaviors. For some of these the asymptotic
dynamics is known to be confined to a finite-\-dimensional
{\em inertial manifold}, though the rigorous upper bounds on
this dimension are not of much use in the practice.

For large spatial extent the complexity of the spatial
motions also needs to be taken into account. The systems
whose spatial correlations decay sufficiently fast, and the
attractor dimension and number of positive Lyapunov exponents
diverges with system size are said\rf{HNZks86,man90b,cross93}
to be extensive, `spatio-temporally chaotic' or `weakly
turbulent.' Conversely, for small system sizes the accurate
description might require a large set\rf{GHCW07} of coupled
ODEs, but dynamics can still be `low-dimensional' in the
sense that it is characterized with one or a few positive
Lyapunov exponents. There is no wide range of scales
involved, nor decay of spatial correlations, and the system
is in this sense only `chaotic.'

For a subset of physicists and mathematicians who study
idealized `fully developed,' `homogenous' turbulence the
generally accepted usage is that the `turbulent' fluid is
characterized by a range of scales and an energy cascade
describable by statistic assumptions\rf{frisch}. What experimentalists,
engineers, geophysicists, astrophysicists actually observe
looks nothing like a `fully developed turbulence.' In the
physically driven wall-bounded shear flows, the turbulence is
dominated by unstable \emph{coherent structures}, that is,
localized recurrent vortices, rolls, streaks and like. The
statistical assumptions fail, and a dynamical systems
description from first principles is called for\rf{Holmes96}.
} %end

Dynamical \statesp\ representation of a PDE is
$\infty$-dimensional, but the KS flow is strongly contracting
and its non-wondering set, and, within it, the set of
invariant solutions investigated here, is embedded into a
finite-dimensional inertial manifold\rf{FNSTks85} in a
non-trivial, nonlinear way. `Geometry' in the title of this
paper refers to our attempt to systematically triangulate
this set in terms of dynamically invariant solutions (\eqva,
\po s, $\ldots$) and their unstable manifolds, in a PDE
representation and numerical simulation algorithm independent
way. The goal is to describe a given `turbulent' flow
quantitatively, not model it qualitatively by a
low-dimensional model. For the case investigated here, the
\statesp\ representation dimension $d \sim 10^2$ is set by
requiring that the exact invariant solutions that we compute
are accurate to $\sim 10^{-5}$.

{
Here comes our quandary. If we ban the words `turbulence' and
`spatiotemporal chaos' from our study of small extent
systems, the relevance of what we do to larger systems is
obscured. The exact unstable coherent structures we determine
pertain not only to the spatially small `chaotic' systems,
but also the spatially large `spatiotemporally chaotic' and
the spatially very large `turbulent' systems.
So, for the lack of more precise nomenclature, we take the
liberty of using the terms `chaos,' `spatiotemporal chaos,'
and `turbulence' interchangeably.
} %end


In previous work, the \statesp\ geometry and the natural measure for
this system have been
studied\rf{Christiansen97,LanThesis,lanCvit07} in terms of unstable
periodic solutions restricted to the antisymmetric subspace of the
KS dynamics.

The focus in this paper is on the role continuous symmetries
play in spatiotemporal dynamics. The notion of exact
periodicity in time is replaced by the notion of relative
spatiotemporal periodicity, and \reqva\ and \rpo s here play
the role the \eqva\ and \po s played in the earlier studies.
Our search for \rpo s in KS system was inspired by Vanessa
L{\'o}pez\rf{lop05rel} investigation of {\rpo s} of the
Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation.  However, there is a vast
literature on {\rpo s} since their first appearance, in
Poincar\'e study of the 3-body problem\rf{ChencinerLink,rtb},
where the Lagrange points are the \reqva.  They arise in
dynamics of systems with continuous symmetries, such as
motions of rigid bodies, gravitational $N$-body problems,
molecules and nonlinear waves. Recently Viswanath\rf{Visw07b}
has found both \reqva\ and \rpo s in
the plane Couette problem.
    {
A Hopf bifurcation of a traveling
wave\rf{AGHO288,AGHks89,Krupa90} induces a small
time-dependent modulation. Brown and Kevrekidis\rf{BrKevr96}
study bifurcation branches of \po s and \rpo s in KS system
in great detail. For our system size ($\alpha=49.04$ in their
notation) they identify a \po\  branch. In this
context \rpo s are referred to as `modulated traveling
waves.' For fully chaotic flows we find this notion too
narrow. We compute 60,000 \po s and \rpo s that are in no
sense small `modulations' of other solutions, hence our
preference for the well established notion of a `\rpo.'
          }

Building upon the pioneering work of
\refrefs{KNSks90,ksgreene88,BrKevr96}, we undertake here a
study of the \KS\ dynamics for a specific system size $L =
22$, sufficiently large to exhibit many of the features
typical of `turbulent' dynamics observed in large KS systems,
but small enough to lend itself to a detailed exploration of
the  \eqva\ and \reqva, their stable/unstable manifolds,
determination of a large number of \rpo s, and a preliminary
exploration of the relation between the observed
spatiotemporal `turbulent' patterns and the \rpo s.

In presence of a continuous symmetry any solution belongs to a group
manifold of equivalent solutions. The problem: If one is to
generalize the \po\  theory to this setting, one needs to
understand what is meant by solutions being nearby (shadowing) when
each solution belongs to a manifold of equivalent solutions. {In a
forthcoming publication\rf{SCD09b} we resolve this puzzle by implementing
symmetry reduction.} Here we demonstrate that, {for \rpo s visiting the
neighborhood of equilibria,} if one picks any
particular solution, the universe of all other solutions is rigidly
fixed through a web of heteroclinic connections between them. This
insight garnered from study of a 1-dimensional \KS\ PDE is more
remarkable still when applied to the plane Couette flow\rf{GHCW07},
with 3-$d$ velocity fields and two translational symmetries.

\section{\KSe\ - a review}
\label{chap:KSreview}

%\item[2011-9-19 CS]
\KSe\ is one of the simple non-linear partial
differential equations. It describes a system in which the transport of
energy through nonlinear mode coupling produces a balance between long
wavelength instability and short wavelength dissipation.
    \PC{Simple? In you reading I am sure you have run into more informative
    descriptions of why people study it (flame fronts, \etc)- keep expanding this
    paragraph as you read the literature}

It has many forms. One of them is \rf{ksgreene88}
    \PC{label the equations you might refer to later;
    for example, some of this is already used in \refeq{eq:KSeGreeneKim},
    improve on that rather than providing a poor cousin version here.}
\beq
y_t = -4y_{xxxx} - \alpha(y_{xx} + \frac{1}{2}y_x^2 - \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} y_x^2\,dx)
\eeq
The system is completed with given initial condition and by assuming
spatial periodicity which we take to be $2\pi$. The fourth order spatial
derivative term comes from dissipation, the second spatial derivative
term gives rise to instability, and the nonlinear term gives rise to mode
coupling. The last term is introduced to keep the level of the solution
constant, i.e., $\partial_t \oint ydx = 0$. The quantity $\alpha$ is the
bifurcation parameter.

If we take a derivative of the last equation with respect to $x$ and
substitute $\mu = y_x/2$ and rescaling as $t \to t/\alpha, x \to -x$ and
$\nu = 4/\alpha$, we recast \refeq{eq:KSeGreeneKim} in the form of \KSe\
that we shall use here:
\beq
\mu_t = (\mu^2)_x - \mu_{xx} - \nu\mu_{xxxx}
\eeq
where $\nu$ is a fourth-order ``hyper-viscosity'' damping parameter.

\subsection{Spatiotemporal chaos in terms of unstable recurrent patterns}
\label{s:Christiansen97}

In the initial work, the \statesp\ geometry and the natural measure for
this system have been
studied\rf{Christiansen97} in terms of unstable
periodic solutions restricted to the antisymmetric subspace of the
KS dynamics. Here are my notes on this Christiansen \etal\ paper.

\begin{description}

\item[2011-08-24 Chao]
The central work of using unstable recurrent patterns describing
spatiotemporal chaos is the search of \po s, especially unstable \po s.
Stable ones are not as important because they are attractive, within
their respective basins of attraction, and display no chaotic behavior.
The unstable ones are typically \emph{saddles}, with both unstable and
stable eigen-directions. In the unstable directions, they shoot out
neighboring points while in the stable directions they pull them in. Thus
dynamics is called ``hyperbolic'' because its linearized behavior is
hyperbolic. Taken together, the set of unstable \po s is the backbone of
chaotic behavior. While we cannot find \emph{all} unstable \po s of a
system (their number is infinite, growing exponentially with the period
of the orbit), we can decompose its dynamics as the combination of
influences of the near \po s.

This paper consists of 5 parts. I mainly focused on the 4th part:
one-dimensional visualization, which illustrate in detail how we find
\po\  and visulize them in low dimensions.

Here is my understanding of the whole process: First we choose a
\PoincSec\ in the full \statesp\ and let the dynamical system evolve for
a sufficiently long time to give us enough points on the section. This
enables us to define a return map $\PoincM$ for the section. Within the section,
iterating the map generates discrete-time \po s, which can be
found out exhaustively (in finite resolution) by utilizing symbolic
dynamics. Before we use symbolic dynamics, we have to build an intrinsic
arc-length coordinate system; for the parameter values studied here, close
to onset of chaos, this return map is approximately unimodal. This
situation is very special, due to only one direction of any \po\ being
unstable. The remaining ones (except for the single marginal eigenvalue
due to time invariance) are strongly contracting.
Since periodic points of a discrete time \po\ belong to the corresponding
continuous time \po\  in the full \statesp\, we can integrate from these
periodic points to recover the full space \po.

Questions:

The third paragraph of part 4:
``The $i$th cycle point  $\arc_i$ is mapped onto its image $\arc_{\sigma i} =
f(\arc_i)$ where $\sigma i$ denotes  the label of the next periodic point in
the cycle.''


So that means $\sigma i$ is not meant to be $\arc_{i+1}$, right? Because the
order of different cycle points is given in following way: ``there exists
a fixed point which is not connected to the attractor (the point
$\overline{0}$ in \reffig{returnmap}) - we choose this fixed point as the
starting point and assign it number $1$. Point number $2$ is the periodic
point in the sample which is closest (in the full space) to this fixed
point, and the $n$th point is determined as the point which has the
minimum distance from the point number $n-1$ among all the periodic
points which have not yet been enumerated. Proceeding this way, we order
all the periodic points that we have found so far.''

So from this we could know that the order of periodic points on the
section is not the order of time evolution of these points. Right? But if
it is true, that seems to contradict with the illustration under figure
4?

\item[2011-08-30, 2011-09-18 Predrag]                            \toCB
For a general orbit we  label points in Poincar\'e section iteration by
\beq
\ssp_{n+1} = \PoincM(\ssp_n)
\ee{discrTime}
where $n=\{1,2,\cdots\}$ denotes the discrete time, and $\ssp$ is a point
in the \statesp\ $\pS \subseteq \reals^d$. For a periodic orbit of period
$n$ we use $\ssp_a$ where $a = \Ssym{1}\Ssym{2}\cdots\Ssym{n}$ is the
symbolic dynamics label of the cycle point  $\ssp_a$, and the dynamics
acts on the label as a cyclic permutation, $\sigma \ssp_a =
\Ssym{2}\cdots\Ssym{n}\Ssym{1}$
\beq
\ssp_{\Ssym{2}\cdots\Ssym{n}\Ssym{1}} =
    f(\ssp_{\Ssym{1}\Ssym{2}\cdots\Ssym{n}})
\,,
\ee{curvPO}
where the block $a=\Ssym{1}\Ssym{2}\cdots\Ssym{n}$ denotes the itinerary
of the periodic point $\ssp_a$ in the prime cycle $\pS_p$. For example,
11100-cycle point $\ssp_{11100}$ is mapped into next cycle point
$\ssp_{11001}$ which can be far away; spatial ordering of cycle points is
given by, for example, alternating binary trees.

In application at hand we discretize the 1-dimensional base segment of
the unstable manifold parametrized by arc-length $\arc$, so there is yet
another integer suffix which refers to a spatially ordered set of points,
for example
\beq
\arc_{j-1} < \arc_{j} < \arc_{j+1}
\,.
\ee{curvPO}
In practice, we have two ways of populating the base segment by points -
either by running a long ergodic orbit and approximating each point on
the strange attractor by the nearest base segment point $\ssp(\arc)$,
labeled by the arc-length $\arc$, as is done in \refref{lanCvit07}, or by
threading a jagged line through the nearest periodic points, and adding
Euclidean distances between them to obtain $\arc$, as was originally done in
\refref{Christiansen97}. We prefer the former, as the latter approach of
necessity runs into ambiguities due to the fractal structure of a strange
attractor along the stable manifold directions, and one misses parts of
the base segment that are not reached by long-time ergodic dynamics.

The dynamics of close returns to the unstable manifold, approximated by
the nearest point on the manifold leads to return map
\beq
\arc_{n+1} = {f}(\arc_n)
\,,
\ee{curvTime}
where suffix $n=\{1,2,\cdots\}$ again denotes the discrete time, as in
\refeq{discrTime}.

\item[2011-9-19 CS]
The recurrent map has fractual structure in full state space and consequently in Poincare section. It means there are infinite many trajectories passing a finite area. For Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the asymptotic dynamics is bounded in a low dimensionl space embedded in the full state space. In the special case here, the dynamics can be roughly considered as one dimensional because there is only one unstable direction and in other directions all the points are rapidly contracting. However, when we want to find periodic orbit, we have to consider the fractual structure becasue there are infinite many points here which may contain a lot of close periodic orbits(or relative periodic orbits).  Along the unstable eigendirection of a periodic orbit, we can do integral to construct a base segment. By parametrizing the segment by arc-length, we obtain a unimodel map. Then using symbolic dynamics we can found all the periodic cycles of this unimodel map, which provide very good initial guess of full state periodic orbits. The reason why the periodic cycles in the unimodel map is just a ``guess'' of periodic orbits in full state space is stated in the beginning that the recurrent map has very complicated fractual internal structure which is just ``roughly'' one dimensional, not exactly one dimensional. On the other hand, the unimodel map is exactly one dimensional and hence is just an approximation of the fractual thin dynamics. So we should start from this approximation to find the actual periodic points belonging to the real full-state-space periodic orbits.

The suffix n in equation 1.4 is discrete time, not in the order of arc-length. So the two equations do not contradict.

\item[2011-08-24 Chao]
A prerequisite question is that from paragraph 2 to paragraph 3, the
phrase ``periodic points'' should mean the points on the 1-dimensional
return map, right? (or points on the $N-1$ dimensional Poincar\'e
section?) If so, since the 1-dimensional return map is a projection from
higher dimension, it could be that two different periodic points have the
same projection? What to do about that?

\item[2011-09-18 Predrag]                            \toCB
The return map \refeq{curvTime} is \emph{not a projection}: every point
on the 1-dimensional curve is a fully specified point in the full
\statesp, $\arc = \ssp(\arc)$, labeled by the arc-length $\arc$. That is precisely
why the approximation of the full dynamics by the iterates of the return
map is so powerful; the return map gives very good guesses for the
location of the next point in a cycle, which can then be pushed to
machine precision by the Newton or variational numerical algorithm used
in the \emph{full \statesp}.

\item[2011-08-24 Chao]
In figure 1, it is said `` The lower arrow indicates the kink where the
invariant set $A$ starts to overlap with $\theta SA$''. I don't understand
how the overlap of A and $\theta SA$ is connected to the kink in the
Feigenbaum tree. I don't have the intuition of how is it like that
``$A$ overlaps with $\theta SA$''. Can you show me some simple examples to
illustrate it pictorially so that I can have an intuitive feeling?

\item[2011-09-03 Chao]
Comparing with the previous paper, \refsect{s:Christiansen97}, this paper
investigates a slightly larger \KS\ system which allows for more than one unstable
eigen-direction. I haven't got much more new things than I did in the previous
one because the idea in this paper is the same with the previous one.

\item[2011-09-12 Predrag] You are a harsh judge of men. Lan worked on
this over 6 years, and there is nothing new? That'll teach him to work
harder next time...
                            \toCB

\begin{itemize}
    \item
This slightly larger \KS\ system allows for more than one important \eqv\
solution, and is the first example of partitioning of its $\infty$\dmn\
\statesp\ into several neighborhoods.
    \item
It discusses the \eqv\ of KS on infinite domain, something not even mentioned
in \refref{Christiansen97}.
    \item
It finds an insanely long \emph{stable} \po, embedded in and visually
indistinguishable of the turbulence around it.
    \item
(Chao, fill in other novelties here...)
\end{itemize}

\item[2011-09-12 Chao]
Sorry for the improper wording. I meant that I could understand more
details in the paper only if I start compute myself such that I can have
more insight of the method and difficulties in this problem. Just that I
have not got yet, doesn't mean that it dosen't have novelties:)

\item[2011-09-03 Chao]

In page 4, section A, it is said ``We pick any point on a typical orbit
of (4). It corresponds to a loop in 3-d state space of (8) and so can be
used to initialize the search for an u(x) profile periodic on [0,L]''.
So, a point in the Fourier space periodic orbit is mapped into a loop in
real space? Don't feel like this is correct.

For your convenience,

equation (4):
\beq
\displaystyle\dot{a}_{k}
= (k/\tilde{L})^{2}(1-(k/\tilde{L})^{2})a_{k}
- (k/\tilde{L})\sum\nolimits^{+\infty}_{m=-\infty}a_{m}a_{k-m}
\eeq

equation (8)
\beq u_x = v, v_x = w, w_x = u^2 - v -E
\eeq
For the rest part of the paper, I think I can well understand them only
if I start computation myself. I don't even know where to start to ask if
I don't go through the process. So I'll record the question here later if
I have any question in my own computation.
Plus, for further study and better understanding of this paper, I should
read \refrefs{ksgreene88}, [33]-[35] in particular.

\item[2011-09-15 Predrag] Citing [33]-[35] numbers from another paper is not
very helpful, to find out what they are one has to find that paper first...

invariant polynomial reduction (Siminos and I believe that is useless in
higher dimensions), but it is pretty good on discrete symmetries.

Chaosbook. Here I rewrite (A.5) and (A.6) as (repeated indices summed over):
\bea
\dot{b}_k &=& \frac{\partial v_k(a)}{\partial a_j}b_j
\continue
v_k(a) &=& \dot{a}_k = (q^2_k - q^4_k)a_k - \frac{iq_k}{2}\sum\nolimits_ma_ma_{k-m}
\continue
\frac{\partial v(a)_k}{\partial a_j} &=&
(q^2_k - q^4_k) - \frac{iq_k}{2}\sum\nolimits_m(\delta_{mj}a_{k-m}+a_m\delta_{j,k-m})
\continue
&=& (q^2_k - q^4_k) - {iq_k}a_{k-j}
\,.
\label{KSstabMat1}
\eea
Combining the last two equations, we obtain:
\beq
\dot{b}_k = (q^2_k - q^4_k)b_k - iq_k\sum\nolimits_ja_{k-j}b_j
\,.
\label{KSstabMat2}
\eeq
The last term is discrete convolution of vector $a$ and $b$ in Fourier space,
which corresponds to component-wise product of two vectors in original
space due to Fourier transform. That is why it has the form in
(A.6).

We have to compute vector $\dot{b}_k$ because we have to observe how a
small deviation from the periodic orbit described by ${a_k,\dot{a}_k}$
evolves and integrate segment by segment(e.g. numerical integral) to
obtain Floquet Multipliers and thus obtain Jacobian matrix and Lyapunov
exponents.

Appendix C gives the searching algorithm of relative periodic orbits. I
got the idea, waiting to embark on real computation to knock down more
blockade.
