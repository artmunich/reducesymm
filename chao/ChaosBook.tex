\chapter{ChaosBook.org blog}
\label{chap:ChaosBook}

\begin{description}

\item[2011-08-24 PC to Chao]
I have created this chapter to collect all your ChaosBook.org
notes in one place.

%   Professor Cvitanovic, I still haven't found out why this blog cannot
%   display bibliography properly on my computer. But I think I will first
%   concentrate on those papers and come to deal with this later.

\item[2011-03-19 CS to PC]
%   Hi Professor Cvitanovic, I manage to make Latex work on my laptop
%   without actually knowing what actually happened, it works anyway. As I
%   tried one bibliography in last conversation.

   Yesterday I finished Chapter 4 but skipped the detail of the some
   examples. We discussed the first half of Chapter 4. Since there're
   pretty much mathematical detail and examples, we decide to break it
   into two parts. By the way, the notation of this chapter at the
   beginning is a little bit confusing and took me a while to get the
   concept of what those formulas really mean. I have some other
   questions about Chapter 4 but but now I am not used to typing math
   symbols here, I might ask you later directly or write it here if I get
   familiar with it.

\item[2011-03-21 PC] You have the dasbuch/book/chapter/*.tex source
code, you can just clip and paste formulas to here.

\item[2011-03-19 CS to PC]
Also I have a question about Example 3.2 in Chapter 3. It states that
   the choice of the coordinates of the pinball game are smart because
   they conserve the phase space volume. I don't understand this, would
   you mind explain it more specifically?

\item[2011-03-25 PC]
Glad you asked the question about choice of billiard coordinates. Please
write up the solution to \refexer{ex_birkhoff}; it's worth doing it in
class as well, a concrete example of how symplectic invariance preserves
area for each $(q,p)$ dual coordinate  pair.

\item[2011-04-19 CS] Done - I have verified in \refexer{ex_birkhoff} that
the 2-form/wedge product is conserved on the \Poincare section.


\item[2011-03-19 CS to PC]
Going from here, I am also
   wondering how to choose phase space coordinates? Does phase/state
   space coordinates have any requirement and whether conservation of
   space volume is such a requirement? What's the meaning of conservation
   of phase space requirement? In my understanding in Hamiltonian flows,
   conservation of phase space volume means conservation of energy, am I
   right?


\item[2011-03-25 PC]
Now, it is more subtle than that; time dependent flow can be symplectic,
but energy is not conserved; I think Percival and D.
Richards\rf{PerRich82N} (I have it in the
\HREF{http://www.cns.gatech.edu/CNS-only/LibraryCat2.htm} {CNS library})
discuss that well. Symplectic invariance is \emph{much stronger}
requirement than either either energy conservation or phase-space volume
conservation, see \HREF{http://chaosbook.org/chapters/newton.pdf}
{Section 7.4 Poincar\'e invariants} and
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/chapters/appendStability.pdf} {Appendix D.4
Stability of Hamiltonian flows}: symplectic transformations preserve area
for each $(q,p)$ dual coordinate  pair.

\item[2011-03-30  CS to PC]
I am now reading Chapter 9. I have a question from the paragraph
following the definition of free action: The splitting of a group
\emph{G} into a stabilizer \emph{$G_{p}$} and \emph{m-1} coset
\emph{$cG_{p}$} relates to an orbit \emph{$M_{p}$} to \emph{m-1} other
distinct orbits \emph{$cM_{p}$}. All of them have equivalent stabilizers,
or more precisely, the points on the same group orbit have
\emph{conjugate stabilizers}: \emph{$G_{cp} = cG_{p}c^{-1}$}. For the
last sentence, does it mean that if \emph{$G_{p}$}  is a stabilizer of
\emph{$M_{p}$}, then \emph{$cG_{p}c^{-1}$} is a stabilizer of
\emph{$cM_{p}$}?

\item[2011-03-31 PC] Yes, you are right. I have now incorporated ``if
\emph{$G_{p}$}  is a stabilizer of \emph{$M_{p}$}, then
\emph{$cG_{p}c^{-1}$} is a stabilizer of \emph{$cM_{p}$}'' into
discrete.tex, thanks.

I intend to excise the dreaded word `stabilizer' from the text, just have
forgotten to do it
\HREF{http://www.flickr.com/photos/birdtracks/4259634492/in/set-72157606259014811/}
{[click]} here. Suggestion - print out the chapter, replace by hand word
`stabilizer' everywhere by 'symmetry' and let's sit together and see
whether the chapter is  easier to read.

\item[2011-04-05 CS] Worked out \refexer{ex_birkhoff}. Finished Chapter 9
with all the details in the examples, have had exemplified pictures of
symmetry and group actions.

\item[2011-04-06 PC] Not so fast - \refexer{ex_birkhoff} is not finished
until you write down your solution.

\item[2011-04-05 CS]
    A question about the last sentence in the first paragraph of Section
    5.4  discussed in the group study last week: Why does the
    neighborhood size scale as $1/|\Lambda_{p}|$? Wouldn't it scale as
    $|\Lambda_{p}|$?

\item[2011-04-06 PC] Mhm, clearly not written clearly enough, but
perhaps the most important property of an unstable flow
that one has to understand. The product of expanding multipliers
$|\Lambda_{p}|$ blows up exponentially with time, but the
\emph{neighborhood shrinks} exponentially with time, Detroit-like.
 Does looking
at Figure 5.1 help? Does reading Sect. 1.5.1 help? If you understand it,
can you rewrite

                                                    \toCB
Nearby points aligned along the stable
(contracting) directions  remain in the neighborhood of the
trajectory $\ssp(t)= \flow{t}{\xInit}$; the ones to keep an eye
on are the points which leave the neighborhood along the
unstable directions because all nonlinear phenomena comes
from these directions. The sub-volume $ |\pS_{\xInit}| = \prod_i^e\Delta
\ssp_i$ of the set of points which get no further away from
$\flow{t}{\xInit}$ than $L$, the typical size of the system, is
fixed by the condition that $\Delta \ssp_i \ExpaEig_i = O(L)$
in each expanding direction $i$. Hence the neighborhood size
scales as
$|\pS_{\xInit}| \propto O(L^{d_e})/|\ExpaEig_p| \propto 1/|\ExpaEig_p| $
where $\ExpaEig_p$ is the
product of expanding Floquet multipliers
(5.7) %\refeq{expVol}
only;
contracting ones play a secondary role.
''

so it makes sense to you. If you and Adam do not understand it, then
bring it up for discussion in the study group.

\item[2011-04-07 CS to PC] Got it.

\item[2011-04-11 CS]
rewrote Paragraph 1 of Section 5.4 as follows:

\CSedit{
Nearby points aligned along the stable (contracting) directions  remain
in the neighborhood of the trajectory $\ssp(t)= \flow{t}{\xInit}$; the
ones to keep an eye on are the points which leave the neighborhood along
the unstable directions because almost all nonlinear and chaotic
phenomena comes from these directions. The sub-volume $ |\pS_{\xInit}| =
\prod_i^e\Delta \ssp_i$ of the set of points which get no further away
from $\flow{t}{\xInit}$ than $L$, the typical size of the system, is
fixed by the condition that $\Delta \ssp_i \ExpaEig_i = O(L)$ in each
expanding direction $i$. Hence the neighborhood size scales as
$|\pS_{\xInit}| \propto O(L^{d_e})/|\ExpaEig_p| \propto 1/|\ExpaEig_p| $
where $\ExpaEig_p$ is the product of expanding Floquet multipliers
(5.7) %\refeq{expVol}
only(see section 1.5.1 and figure 1.9 for example);
contracting ones play a secondary role}


\item[2011-04-12 PC] Thanks, I have now rewritten introduction of
Chapter 5 as well as the section 5.4 is the spirit you suggest,
emphasizing the key role the concept of 'neighborhood' will play.

\item[2011-04-11 CS]
Finished Chapter 6. Generally be able to understand it but feel like
there's whole lot more content underneath that as in the KS
transformation for example. There should be a lot tricks and methods to
construct such regularization. And I wonder what kind of singularity
could be regularized. But I guess that this is not an easy question and
should not be the emphasis to my project.


\item[2011-04-11 CS]
A trivial error: eqn.(6.13) should be "$\sqrt{x}dx = 2dt$",
rather than "$\sqrt{x}dx = \sqrt{2}dt$"

\item[2011-04-12 PC]
No error is 'trivial.' Thanks.

\item[2011-04-12 PC] Remember to write up your solution to
\refexer{ex_birkhoff} before you forget it. If it is good, we might
rewrite the Chapter 8 {\em Billiards} before the study group takes it up.

\item[2011-04-12 CS] I'll present Chap.8 next Friday as planned. Since a
test on Friday is waiting for me, I'll write the solution on weekends.

\item[2011-04-19 CS] Now I am reading Chapter 10, stuck at understanding eqn.(10.16):
\[
\oint\frac{d\theta}{2\pi}(\textbf{T}u(\theta))^{\emph{T}}\textbf{T}u(2\pi-\theta)
 = \sum\limits_{m=0}^{\infty}m^{2}(u_{1}^{(m)2}+u_{2}^{(m)2})
\]
First, why would there be a integral on left hand side?
Second, why the integrand is $(\textbf{T}u(\theta))^{\emph{T}}\textbf{T}u(2\pi-\theta)$? Shouldn't it be
 $(\textbf{T}u(\theta))^{\emph{T}}\textbf{T}u(\theta)$ according to eqn.(10.11)?.

\item[2011-04-20 PC] $u(\theta)$ is a function on the interval $[0,2\pi]$,
hence integral on the left side (LHS). Compact support, hence the infinite sum
on the RHS. If I remember right (check notes or the textbook from
our Math Methods course) for Fourier transforms, a convolution on the
left hand side gives me a product on the right hand side. If I'm wrong,
let me know so I fix this; as you say, does not look like $L^2$ norm...

\item[2011-04-20 PC]  I think that in \refexer{ex_birkhoff} you want to
have different radii $a_i$ for the two disks. If you do that, you have
the general map for a billiard with a smooth boundary, as you only need the
local radius of curvature. Also, while showing that
the 2-form/wedge product is conserved on the \Poincare section might make
Adam and friends happy, what you really need is the explicit $[2\!\times\!2]$
Jacobian matrix, because you will need to compute its eigenvalues - I do not see
how you do that from the wedge product alone. Once you have the \jacobianM,
the area preservation is immediate, as you will show that $|\det \jMP |= 1$.
% {\jMP}{\ensuremath{\hat{J}}}   % jacobian matrix, Poincare return

\item[2011-4-22 CS to PC 06:32am]  Generalized the proof in the exercise
to different radius and wrote out the Jacobian matrix. But what's
interesting as you can below is that as long as my previous proof when
the two circles are identical is correct, there's no way that the
Jacobian in the case of unequal radius is one. You can easily see that
the map: $(\theta_1, \sin(\phi_1))\Rightarrow(\theta_2, \sin(\phi_2))$ is
still volume-preserving in same way. Plus the fact that $s=a\theta$,
there must be a factor of ratio of two radius comes in. You can visualize
this effect when you expand or compress the circle in the righthand side.
So I guess Birkhoff coordinates $(s,p)$ just preserve phase space volume
when the radius are equal. Right?

\item[2011-4-22 PC] No.

\item[2011-4-22 CS]
You're right. I checked the proof again and found out that in the map of
$p$, I missed a factor $\frac{a_1}{a_2}$ in front of $p_1$ and other two
$\frac{1}{a_2}$ factors before the remaining two terms. Now the result is
happy. It seems that caffeine can not perfectly replace sleep.

\item[2011-04-22 PC]
I'm feeling better, too. I'll try to unconvolute your derivation (your
`sine laws' are formulas for the impact parameters in my hand-drawn
billiard maps), but you will feel even more alert if you can
verify (or reduce your formulas to) the ChaosBook formulas
\refeq{hor}, \refeq{eq_her} and \refeq{eq_her}.

\item[2011-07-19 CS]
I have some questions about Chap.12 "Stretch, fold, prune" listed below.

In my understanding, in a non-wandering and chaotic set, any unstable
trajectory is ergodic. That means the trajectory will finally visit any
infinitesimally small volume in the set. Right?

\item[2011-07-20 PC]                                        \toCB
Please reread chapter ``Flows,'' alert me if the question is not answered
there (`metrically transitive,, etc...). It is trickier than
`infinitesimally small volume,' as the strange attractors tend to be
fractal.

\item[2011-07-19 CS]
I don't quite understand the last sentence of the second last paragraph
before 12.1.1 when you say ``the trick is to stop continuing an invariant
manifold while the going is still good.'' By `the going is still good,' do
you mean that we should stop when we find that the trajectory will be
attracted to an equilibrium and never get out of a certain true subset of
the whole non-wandering set?

\item[2011-07-19 CS]
About Example 12.3 H\'enon repeller complete horseshoe:
First, in figure 12.4, why after one step's evolution, point B occupies
point D's original spot and also point C and point D are in the stable
manifold? I don't think this is just a coincidence but still haven't
figure out the reason.

\item[2011-07-20 PC]                                        \toCB
Concerning the H\'enon attractor \underline{not} being symmetric across
the diagonal in general: check my
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/version13/Maribor11.shtml}{Maribor lectures}.
In \HREF{http://chaosbook.org/overheads/dimension/dimension.pdf}{piece
\#5}: ``Dynamics in infinitely many dimensions'' slide 10 shows the
stable / unstable manifolds for the canonical H\'enon attractor - clearly
very asymmetric.

\item[2011-07-19 CS]
Secondly, in 1-dimensional symbolic dynamics, the itinerary $\gamma$ has a
simple relation with space coordinate x that $if \gamma(x_1) <
\gamma(x_2), x_1<x_2$. Does this hold in 2-dimensional Smale Horseshoe
for just one component of the symbol plane)? I ask this because I think
this is related to why do you assign the left and lower part to be 0, and
the right and higher part to be 1 (figure 12.4). Also, what if after the
first step of evolution, the lower part and the higher part is still
connected, not completely cut off by the boundary?(Is this just a special
case of incomplete Smale Horseshoe?)

I saw the spirit in symbolic dynamics approximating periodic orbits by
infinite binary sequence as we approximating an irrational number by
infinite sequence of rational number. But I still haven't see the
connection between symbolic dynamics and my work. Can you give some
instructions?

Lastly, I'm not very clear about the last three paragraphs of section
12.1.1?

\item[2011-07-20 PC] I have answered the above questions on the board,
and asked Chao to enter here answers as he understood them; we'll see
whether further discussion is needed after that.

\item[2011-07-22 CS] I read the Smale Horseshoe part in Kai's thesis. Now
I understand why the binary sequence has to be assigned this way. Only in
this way can the symbol represent the actual map. It's hard to describe
it but this picture found from wiki helped me a lot.

In Kai's thesis, he mentioned ``since the horseshoe is a diffeomorphism
we need to know both the future and the past.'' With the help of this
picture I kind of understand this.

Also I found something interesting that animate the procedure of H\'enon
map horseshoe:

I had noticed Demidov's website before - you are right, these simulations
are very instructive, I have now added a remark about them to ChaosBook.
He uses a different definition for parameters $a$ and $b$ from H\'enon,
but unfortunately uses the same letters. His definition is natural if one
is interested in Julia sets, but unfortunately not the one H\'enon used,
and I always try to follow the foundational papers, rather than confusing
everybody with sly parameter redefinitions.

\item[2011-07-24 CS and PC]                                        \toCB
H\'enon's parametrization\rf{henon}:
\index{Henon@H\'enon map}
\index{map!H\'enon}
\bea
    x_{n+1}&=&1-ax^2_n+b y_n
        \continue
    y_{n+1}&=& x_n
\,.
\label{eq2.1a}
\eea
Demidov's parametrization\rf{DemChaos} of the H\'enon map is:
\bea
    x_{n+1}' &=& a'+ {x'}{}^2_n + b' y_n'
        \continue
    y_{n+1}' &=& x_n'
\,.
\label{DemidHen}
\eea
Dividing through by $a'$ we get
\(
\frac{x_{n+1}'}{a'} = 1 + a'\left(\frac{x_n'}{a'}\right)^2 + b'\frac{y_n'}{a'}
\,,
\)
    \CS{my formula was
\[
\frac{x''}{a'}=1+\frac{1}{a'}x^2+\frac{b'}{a'}y
\]
    }
so the two parametrizations are related by:
    \CS{my guess was
\[ %beq
x={x'}/{a'}
\,,\qquad
a=-{1}/{a'}
\,,\qquad b= {b'}/{a'}
\] %ee{DemidHenChao}
    }
\beq
x={x'}/{a'}
\,,\quad
y={y'}/{a'}
\,;\qquad
a=-{a'}
\,,\quad b= {b'}
\,.

\item[2011-07-24 PC]
You need the transformation between two definitions, if you are
going to use Demidov's simulations to test your ideas, and it helps greatly
if the transformation formula is the correct one. Please recheck
whether I am right in correcting your argument, and whether if you chose
\(
a'=-6
\,,\quad
b'= -1
\)
Demidov's java applets reproduce the figures in ChaosBook?

\item[2011-07-22 CS] BTW, I forgot to ask the first question on the list
yesterday "In my understanding, in a non-wandering and chaotic set, any
unstable trajectory is ergodic. That means the trajectory will finally
visit any infinitesimally small volume in the the set. Right?"

\item[2011-07-23 PC]
Mhm... I wrote a suggestion what to read above already, dated {\bf
2011-07-20 PC}. After rereading the discussion in ChaosBook, let me know
what is missing there...
