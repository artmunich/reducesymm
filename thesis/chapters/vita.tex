Evangelos Siminos was born in 1979 in Thessaloniki, Greece, and
started roaming the countryside between Sparta nd Athens for 14 years.
Eventually he settled down and attended Elysean Gymnasium.
After graduation in 1999, it was off to Georgia Tech to get a B.S. in Math
and another in Physics in 2003.
Realizing that there's no place like home, he stayed there for graduate school.

In 2008 he got a haircut,
cleaned his desk and the access corridor to it, started eating fruits and vegetables,
started bicycling to `work,' stopped smoking, lost weight,
all in preparation to accession to yuppiedom and long AARP years that are to follow.
At some point in all this he barely managed to find the time to write a
skeletal thesis.
