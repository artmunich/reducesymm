systems described by Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and independently by Sivashinsky\rf{siv} to describe instabilities in laminar flame fronts
but also appears in a variety of contexts including thin falling films\rf{BenKS66,LinKS74}, interfacial instabilities between concurent viscous fluids, drift waves in plasmas. 
% For an instructive derivation from Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation \cf~\rf{}.

Our motivation for its study is that it is one of the simplest nonlinear PDEs that
exhibit spatiotemporally chaotic behavior. Moreover the dynamics in the chaotic regime are
interesting in their own right.

 In the formulation
adopted here, the time evolution of the `flame front velocity'
$u=u(x,t)$ on a periodic domain $u(x,t) = u(x+L,t)$ is given by
\beq
  u_t = F(u) = -{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}(u^2)_x-u_{xx}-u_{xxxx}
    \,,\qquad   x \in [-L/2,L/2]
    \,.
\ee{ks}
Here $t \geq 0$ is the time, and $x$ is the spatial coordinate.
The subscripts $x$ and $t$ denote partial derivatives with respect to
$x$ and $t$. In what follows
we shall state results of all calculations either in units of the
`dimensionless system size' $\tildeL$, or the system size $L = 2 \pi
\tildeL$.All numerical results presented in this thesis
are for the system size $\tildeL=22/2\pi = 3.5014\ldots$.
Spatial periodicity $u(x,t)=u(x+L,t)$
makes it convenient to work in the Fourier space,
\beq
  u(x,t)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} a_k (t) e^{ i k x /\tildeL }
\,,
\ee{eq:ksexp}
with the $1$-dimensional PDE \refeq{ks}
replaced by an infinite set of
ODEs for the complex Fourier coefficients $a_k(t)$:
\beq
\dot{a}_k= \pVeloc_k(a)
     = ( q_k^2 - q_k^4 )\, a_k
    - i \frac{q_k}{2} \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} a_m a_{k-m}
\,,
\ee{expan}
where $q_k = k/\tildeL$.
Since $u(x,t)$ is real, $a_k=a_{-k}^\ast$, and we can replace the
sum by a $k > 0$ sum.

Due to the hyperviscous damping $u_{xxxx}$, long time solutions of KS
equation are smooth, $a_k$ drop off fast
with $k$, and truncations of \refeq{expan} to $16 \leq N \leq 128$
terms yield accurate solutions for system sizes considered here (see
Appendix~\ref{sec:fourierRLD}).  Robustness of the long-time dynamics
of KS as a function of the number of Fourier modes kept in truncations
of \refeq{expan} is, however, a subtle issue.  Adding an extra mode to
a truncation of the system introduces a small perturbation in the
space of dynamical systems.  However, due to the lack of structural
stability both as a function of truncation $N$, and the system size
\tildeL, a small variation in a system parameter can (and often will)
throw the dynamics into a different asymptotic state.  For example,
asymptotic attractor which appears to be chaotic in a $N$-dimensional
\statesp\ truncation can collapse into an attractive cycle
for $(N\!+\!1)$-dimensions.



\subsection{Symmetries of \KSe}
\label{sec:KSeSymm}

The KS equation is Galilean invariant: if $u(x,t)$ is a solution,
then $u(x -ct,t) -c $, with $c$ an arbitrary constant
speed, is also a solution. Without loss of generality, in our
calculations we shall set the mean velocity of the front to zero,
\beq \int dx \, u = 0 \,. \ee{GalInv}
As $\dot{a_0}=0$ in
\refeq{expan}, $a_0$ is a conserved quantity
fixed to $a_0=0$ by the condition \refeq{GalInv}. $G$, the group of actions $ g \in G $ on a
\statesp\ (reflections, translations, \etc) is a symmetry of the KS
flow \refeq{ks} if $g\,u_t = F(g\,u)$.
The KS equation is time translationally invariant, and space translationally invariant
on a periodic domain under
the 1-parameter group of
$O(2): \{\Shift_{\shift/L},\Refl \}$.
If $u(x,t)$ is a solution, then
$\Shift_{\shift/L}\, u(x,t) = u(x+\shift,t)$
is an equivalent solution for any shift
$-L/2 < \shift \leq L/2$,
as is the
reflection (`parity' or `inversion')
\beq
    \Refl \, u(x) = -u(-x)
\,.
\ee{KSparity}
The translation operator action on the Fourier coefficients \refeq{eq:ksexp},
represented here by a complex valued vector
$a = \{a_k\in\mathbb{C}\,|\,k = 1, 2, \ldots\}$, is given by
\beq
  \Shift_{\shift/L}\, a = \mathbf{g}(\shift) \, a \,,
  \label{eq:shiftFour}
\eeq
where $\mathbf{g}(\shift) = \mathrm{diag}( e^{i q_k\, \shift} )$ is a complex
valued diagonal matrix, which amounts to the $k$-th mode complex plane
rotation by an angle $k\, \shift /\tildeL$.  The reflection acts on
the Fourier coefficients by complex conjugation,
\beq
  \Refl \, a = -a^\ast
\,.
\ee{FModInvSymm}
Reflection generates the dihedral subgroup $D_1 = \{1, \Refl\}$
of $O(2)$.
