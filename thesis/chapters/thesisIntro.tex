The studies of the \KS\ system
\beq
  u_t = F(u) = -{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}(u^2)_x-u_{xx}-u_{xxxx}
    \,,\qquad   x \in [-L/2,L/2]
\ee{intro:ks}
in \refrefs{Christiansen97,lanCvit07,LanThesis} restricted the dynamics
to the space of antisymmetric functions $u(-x,t)=-u(x,t)$ by imposing
boundary condition $u(-L/2,t)=u(L/2,t)=0$, \cf\ \refsect{sec:KSe} for more
detail. This restriction eliminated the translational symmetry \KS\ equation
has when supplied with more general periodic boundary condition $u(x+L,t)=u(x,t)$ or
in an unbounded domain $x\in(-\infty,\infty)$. Even though working in the antisymmetric
subspace is mathematically and computationally convenient and the dynamics are far
from trivial for sufficiently large system size, many of the interesting solutions,
such as traveling waves are eliminated. We do not need to try hard to motivate the
study of traveling solutions, they are present in all fluid simulations and experiments
mentioned in \refsect{s:hopf} and ubiquitous in physics.

Going on with the discussion in the context of \KS\ system we observe that as soon as
we relax the antisymmetric boundary conditions and choose to work with periodic boundaries
\KS\ equation becomes invariant under the 1-$d$ Lie group of $O(2)$ rotations: if
$u(x,t)$ is a solution, then $u(x+d,t)$ is an equivalent
solution for any $-L/2 < d \leq L/2$.
As a result,
KS can have \rpo\ solutions with nonzero shift
\beq
u(x+d,\period{}) = u(x,0)
\,.
\ee{KSrpos}
where $\period{}$ is the period and recurrence becomes
relative: The periodic orbits that organized \statesp\ in
\refrefs{Christiansen97,lanCvit07,LanThesis} are now not the
only generic solutions, we are also faced with relative
periodic orbits, solutions that repeat them self up to a
translation. were introduced by Poincar\'e in his study of the
3-body problem\rf{ChencinerLink,rtb}. In PDE's they are also
known as modulated traveling waves and they have been found and
studied, for example in \KS\ equation\rf{BrKevr96}, Complex
Ginzburg-Landau equation\rf{lop05rel}, plane Couette
flow\rf{Visw07b}. A striking recent application of \rpo s has
been the discovery of ``choreographies'' of $N$-body problems%
\rf{CheMon00,CGMS02,McCordMontaldi}.
