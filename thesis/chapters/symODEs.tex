\subsection{Definition of symmetry}

We consider a system of \ode's of the form
\beq
	\dot{x} = \vf(x,\lambda)
	\label{eq:difeq}
\eeq
where $\vf: \Rls{n}\times\Rls{r}$ a $C^\infty$ mapping. When
not important we will suppress the $r$-dimensional vector of parameters
$\lambda$ in the notation.

As is well known any compact Lie group acting on $\Rls{n}$ can be identified
with a subgroup of $\On{n}$, \cf\ for example \refref{golubII}
for a sketch of the proof. Therefore, without loss of generality
we will concentrate on subgroups $\Gamma\subseteq\On{n}$ in the following.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:symmetry}
\index{symmetry}
We call a group element $\gamma\in\On{n}$ a symmetry of \refeq{eq:difeq} if for every solution
$x(t)$, $\gamma x(t)$ is also a solution.
\end{definition}

The question now arises on how to check for symmetries of \refeq{eq:difeq} since
we generally do not have knowledge of the set of all solutions. Let $x(t)$ be a solution
of \ref{eq:difeq}. Then by \refDef{def:symmetry} $y(t)=\gamma x(t)$ is another solution
and therefore satisfies \refneq{eq:difeq}:
\[
 \dot{y}(t)=\vf{y(t)}=\vf(\gamma x(t))\,.
\]
On the other hand
\[
 \dot{y}(t)=\gamma \dot{x} = \gamma \vf(x(t))\,,
\]
for any solution $x(t)$. Since solutions exist for any $x\in\Rls{n}$ we are led to the following
condition for $\gamma$ to be a symmetry of \refeq{eq:difeq}:
\beq
	\vf(\gamma x) =\gamma \vf(x)
	\label{eq:equiv}
\eeq
for all $x\in\Rls{n}$. We say that $\vf$ \emph{commutes} with $\gamma$ or that $\vf$ is $\gamma$-\emph{equivariant}.
When $\vf$ commutes with all $\gamma\in\Gamma$ we say that $\vf$ is $\Gamma$-equivariant\index{equivariant}.
% When $f$ is $\gamma$-equivariant
% the \ode~ \ref{eq:difeq} remains invariant under the action of $\gamma$.

Clearly the finite time flow $\flow{t}{\gamma x_o}$ through $\gamma x_o$
satisfies the equivariance condition $\flow{t}{\gamma x_o}=\gamma \flow{t}{x_o}$ from
the definition of symmetry and uniqueness of solutions.


\index{Lorenz equations!symmetry}
For example, the vector field in Lorenz equations  \refneq{eq:lorenz} is equivariant under the group
$\Zn{2}\cong\Dn{1}$ acting on \Rls{3} by
\[
	\Rot{\pi}(x,y,z) = (-x,-y,z)\,.
\]
Notice that this transformation can be considered as either as rotation by $\pi$ around the $z$ axis (hence the
group \Zn{2}) or as a reflection about the origin in a plane perpendicular to the $z$-axis (hence the group \Dn{1}).

\index{Complex Lorenz equations!symmetry}
As another example, the vector field in \CLe\ \refneq{eq:CLe} is equivariant under the group \SOn{2} acting on $\Rls{5}\cong \Clx{2}\times \Rls{}$
by
\beq
 \Rot{\theta} (x,y,z) = (e^{i\theta} x, e^{i\theta} y, z)\,,\ \ \  \theta\in[0,2\pi)\,.
 \label{eq:RotCLe}
\eeq

\index{Armbruster-Guckenheimer-Holmes flow!symmetry}Finally, the symmetry group of the \AGHe~\refneq{eq:AGH} is \On{2} acting by
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \Rot{\theta}(z_1,z_2) &=& (e^{i\theta} z_1, e^{i 2\theta} z_2)\,,\ \ \  \theta\in[0,2\pi)\,,\\
  \Refl(z_1,z_2) &=& (\conj{z}_1,\conj{z}_2)\,.
\end{eqnarray*}


\subsection{Phase space stratification}

In order to understand the implications of equivariance for the solutions
of \refeq{eq:difeq} we first have to closely examine the way a compact
Lie group acts on \Rls{n}.

\index{group orbit} The \emph{group orbit} of $x\in\Rls{n}$ is the set
\beq
	\Gamma x = \{\gamma x: \gamma\in\Gamma\}\,.
\eeq

\begin{definition}
\label{def:stab}
\index{isotropy subgroup}\index{stabilizer} Define the \emph{isotropy subgroup} or \emph{stabilizer} of $x\in\Rls{n}$ as
\beq
	\stab{x}=\{\gamma\in\Gamma:\gamma x=x\}\,.
\eeq
\end{definition}
Thus the isotropy subgroup describes the symmetries of a point $x$. Notice that by
definition \refDef{def:stab} the isotropy subgroup is the largest subgroup (in the
sense of set inclusion, \cf \refeq{eq:Gorder}) that leaves $x$ fixed. The following usefull lemma
relates the isotropy subgroups of points on the same group orbit.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:stabGorbit}
Points on the same group orbit of $\Gamma$ have conjugate isotropy subgroups:
\beq
	\stab{\gamma x}=\gamma \stab{x} \gamma^{-1}\,.
\eeq
\end{lemma}
See \refref{golubII} for the proof.

\refLem{lem:stabGorbit} implies that we can characterize a group orbit by its \emph{type}, defined
as the conjugacy class of its isotropy subgroups.

\begin{proposition}
 Let $\Gamma$ be a compact Lie group acting on \Rls{n}. Then
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item If $\Gamma$ is finite then $|\Gamma|=|\stab{x}||\Gamma x|$.
  \item If $\Gamma$ is continuous then $\dim \Gamma = \dim \stab{x}+\dim \Gamma x$.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
The proof can be found in \refref{golubII}. We note a usefull relation from the proof: $\dim\Gamma x =\dim(\Gamma/\stab{x})$, where the \emph{coset space} of a subgroup $\Sigma$  of $\Gamma$ is defined as $\Gamma/\Sigma=\{\gamma\Sigma|\gamma\in\Gamma\}$. Also recall that the (left) \emph{cosets} of $\Sigma$ in $\Gamma$ are the sets $\gamma\Sigma=\{\gamma\sigma|\sigma\in\Sigma\}$.

\index{stratum}
Therefore, when $\Gamma$ is continuous each group orbit is a smooth compact manifold of dimension
$\dim \Gamma x=\dim \Gamma-\dim \stab{x}$. The union of orbits of the same type is called a \emph{stratum}
and is itself a smooth manifold. Thus \Rls{n} is stratified by the action of $\Gamma$ into
a disjoint union of strata which are in an $1-1$ correspondance to the group orbit types. Notice that in general
the strata do not have the same dimension.

\begin{definition}
 \label{def:fixedsp}
 \index{fixed-point subspace} Let $\Sigma$ be a subgroup of $\Gamma$ acting on \Rls{n}. The \fixedsp\ of $\Sigma$, denoted by $Fix(\Sigma)$, is the subspace of \Rls{n} containing all fixed points of $\Sigma$:
\[
	Fix(\Sigma)=\{x\in\Rls{n}\ |\ \sigma x = x\,,\ \forall \sigma\in\Sigma\}\,.
\]
\end{definition}

\Fixedsp s are important because they are invariant under equivariant dynamics. The following theorem applies:

\begin{theorem}
 Let $f:\Rls{n}\rightarrow\Rls{n}$ be $\Gamma$-equivariant and let $\Sigma$ be a subgroup of $\Gamma$. Then
\[
 f\left(Fix(\Sigma)\right)\subseteq Fix(\Sigma)\,.
\]
\end{theorem}\ES{write the proof}

This leads to: 
\begin{proposition}
 Let $x(t)$ be a solution trajectory of an equivariant ODE. Then $\Sigma_{x(t)}=\Sigma_{x(0)}$ for all $t$.
\end{proposition}\ES{write the proof}

We can define a partial ordering $\preceq$ on conjugacy classes of subgroups of $\Gamma$. Let $H=\{H_i\}$ and $K=\{K_j\}$
be two such conjugacy classes. Then
\beq
	H\preceq K \Leftrightarrow H_i\subseteq K_j
	\label{eq:Gorder}
\eeq
for some representatives $H_i,\,K_j$. We refer to the partially ordered set that results from this ordering as the \emph{subgroup lattice}.

\begin{definition}
 The isotropy lattice of $\Gamma$ is the set of all conjugacy classes of isotropy subgroups 
 partially ordered by $\preceq$.
\end{definition}
\ES{I copy Golubitsky and Stewart's definition of isotropy lattice and partial ordering (but not of subgroup lattice) 
here because I am somewhat confused. Are the conjugacy classes of subgroups distinct
from the classes defined by conjugate elements of the group? 
For instance in the example of \Dn{3} bellow, $\Zn{2}(\Refl)$, $\Zn{2}(\Refl \Drot)$ 
and $\Zn{2}(\Refl \Drot^2)$ are conjugate subgroups. My interpretation is that we call this a conjugacy class of isotropy subgroups.
On the other hand, \Dn{3} is partioned in three classes: $\{e\},\{\Refl,\Refl\Drot,\Refl\Drot^2\}$ 
and $\{\Drot,\Drot^2\}$ which of course are not subgroups, except for $\{e\}$.}

\begin{example}
As an example we will consider \Dn{3}, the symmetry group of the equilateral triangle, \cf~\reffig{fig:D3triangle}, acting on $\Rls{2}\cong\Clx{}$ by
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \Drot z &=& e^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}} z\,,\\
  \Refl z  &=& \conj{z}\,.
\end{eqnarray*}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\caption[D3 symmetry illustration.]{
    {\small
    \Dn{3} leaves the equilateral triangle setwise fixed. The reflection symmetry axes have been denoted $I_i$.}}
\label{fig:D3triangle}
    \vspace*{-5pt}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There are, up to conjugacy, three subgroups: $\Idg=\{e\}$, $\Zn{2}(\Refl)$, which is isomorfic to the subgroups generated 
by $\Refl\Drot$ and by $\Refl\Drot^2$, and $\Zn{3}=\{e,\Drot,\Drot^2\}$. The subgroup lattice is shown in \reffigpart{fig:D3lattice}{a}.
It is easy to see that there are three classes, each corresponding to a distinct geometrical operation: $\{e\},\{\Refl,\Refl\Drot,\Refl\Drot^2\}$ 
and $\{\Drot,\Drot^2\}$.

Now we examine how the vertex $A$ of the triangle transforms under the axion of \Dn{3}. Under $\Drot$ and $\Drot^2$ it is mapped
to the other two vertices $B$ and $C$, respectively. Thus all vertices belong to the same group orbit and have conjugate isotropy subgroups, from \refLem{lem:stabGorbit}. Under $\Refl$ vertex $A$ remains fixed. Thus the isotropy subgroup of point $A$ is $\stab{A}=\Zn{2}(\Refl)$. By
\refLem{lem:stabGorbit} we have $\stab{B}=\Drot\, \Zn{2}(\Refl)\, \Drot^{-1} = \Zn{2}(\Refl\Drot)$ and $\stab{C}=\Drot\, \Zn{2}(\Refl)\, \Drot^{-1} 
= \Zn{2}(\Refl\Drot^2)$. Next, notice that $\Zn{2}(\Refl)$ fixes any point on the symmetry axis $I_1$, while $\Drot$ and $\Drot^2$ map it to $I_2$
and $I_3$, respectively. The origin is the only point fixed by any group operation, \ie~has isotropy subgroup $\Dn{3}$. Finally,
any point that is not on one of the symmetry axes $I_1,\ I_2,\ I_3$ has trivial isotropy subgroup. Thus we arrive to the following conclusions:

The isotropy subgroups are: $\stab{\{0\}}=\Dn{3}$, $\stab{I_1^*}=\Zn{2}(\Refl)\simeq\stab{I_2^*}\simeq\stab{I_3^*}$, $\stab{\Rls{2}\backslash\{\cap I_i\}}=\Idg$, 
where $I_i^*$ is used as a shortcut for $I_i\backslash\{0\}$. The fixed point subspaces of \Dn{3}, $\Zn{2}(\Refl)$, $\Zn{2}(\Refl\Drot)$ and $\Zn{2}(\Refl\Drot^2)$ 
are the origin, $I_1$, $I_2$ and $I_3$, respectively. The fixed point subspace of \Zn{3} is the origin but, since \Zn{3} is a proper subgroup of \Dn{3},
the former does not qualify as isotropy subgroup of the origin (\cf~\refDef{def:stab}.) Thus \Zn{3} is not in the isotropy lattice
of \Dn{3} acting on \Rls{2}, \cf~\reffigpart{fig:D3lattice}{b}.

\end{example}

There is a general procedure to determine which subgroups in the subgroup lattice of a group $\Gamma$ are isotropy 
subgroups\ES{cite Gatermann} when $\Gamma$ acts faithfully on $\Rls{n}$. 
For each subgroup $K$ (or more precisely for each subgroup class represented by $K$) 
determine the dimension of the \fixedsp. Then we trace the subgroup lattice: For each subgroup
$K$ we compare $dim(Fix(K))$ to $dim(Fix(H))$ for every $H\subseteq\Gamma$ for which $K\subset H$. 
If  $dim(Fix(K))=dim(Fix(H))$ then $K$ is not an isotropy subgroup. The determination of the dimension of the 
\fixedsp of a subgroup $K$ can be done by means of the following trace formula if an explicit representation
$\rho(K)$ of $K$ is known\ES{Or if one is able to determine the character of the representation by other means.}:
\beq
	dim(Fix(K))=\frac{1}{|K|}\sum_{\kappa\in K} trace(\rho(\kappa))\,.
\eeq

% In general, once the subgroup lattice has been determined one goes up the lattice comparing the dimensions of fixed point subspace for


% We observe that points on reflection symmetry axis $I_1$ are in the \fixedsp\ of


% The notion of equivariance is related to the symmetries of the \ode\ \refeq{eq:difeq}. We will also

\subsection{Moving frames}

In this section we present the method of moving coframes
    \PC{do they really say ``moving coframes'' rather than ``comoving frames''? ES: Yes, they really do. They refer to
Cartan's method as method of ``moving frames'' and they claim it to be a special (less rigorous) case of the moving coframe method. 
I don't know Cartan's method and the two papers of Fels and Olver\rf{FelsOlver98,FelsOlver99} are lengthy and technical. Olver's
book is readable but I it doesn't describe Cartan's method. I think they say ``moving'' rather than ``comoving" frames
because one only comoves in the direction of group action.}
of Fels and Olver\rf{FelsOlver98,FelsOlver99}, also \cf~\refref{OlverInv} for
a pedagogical exposition. The method can be used to generate functionally independent fundamental invariants for the action
of a group $\Gamma$ on a space $V$ under certain conditions. The method draws inspiration from the method of moving frames of
Cartan.
    \ES{cite Cartan}
Here we follow \refref{OlverInv} but first motivate the method through an example.

Consider $\Sigma=\SOn{2}$ acting on $\Rls{5}$ by
\beq
	x \mapsto  \Rot{\theta}x\,,
	\label{eq:SO2act}
\eeq
where
\beq
	\Rot{\theta}=	\left(\barr{ccccc}
				\cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) & 0	   & 0		    & 0\\
				\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)  & 0	   & 0		    & 0\\		
				0	     & 	0	     & \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) & 0\\
				0	     &  0	     & \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) & 0\\
				0	     &  0	     & 0	    & 0		   & 1\\	
			\earr\right)\,,\ \ \theta\in[0,2\pi)\,.
\eeq
Notice that this is the same action as in \refeq{eq:RotCLe} but now we don't make the identification
$\Rls{5}\cong \Clx{2}\times \Rls{}$. Thus the following have direct application in symmetry reduction
of \CLe. Choose coordinates $x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2,z$ on $\Rls{5}$. Notice that the \fixedsp\
of the action of $\SOn{2}$ defined above is the $z$-axis.
    \PC{where is \fixedsp\ defined? ES: Sorry, it's there now. See \refDef{def:fixedsp}}.
The isotropy subgroup of the $z$-axis is thus
$\SOn{2}$, while the isotropy subgroup of $V_R\equiv\Rls{5}\backslash\{x_1=x_2=y_1=y_2=0\}$ is the identity element.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:free}
\index{free}
A group $\Gamma$ acts freely on $V$ if all isotropy subgroups are trivial: \stab{x}=\{e\} for all $x\in V$.
$\Gamma$ acts locally freely if all isotropy subgroups are discrete subgroups of $\Gamma$.
\end{definition}

Thus $\Sigma$ does not act freely on $\Rls{5}$ but acts freely on $V_R$. If we don't
restrict $\theta$ in $[0,2\pi)$ then the group $\Rls{}$ acts locally freely on $V_R$
since the isotropy subgroup is the discrete subgroup $2\pi\mathbb{Z}$ of integer multiples of $2\pi$.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:faithfull}
\index{faithfull}
A group $\Gamma$ acts faithfully (or effectively) on $V$ if it has trivial global isotropy subgroup.
\end{definition}
\ES{define global isotropy subgroup}

\begin{definition}
\label{def:regular}
\index{regular}\index{semi-regular}
A group $\Gamma$ acts semi-regularly on $V$ if all its orbits have the same dimension. If in addition for each point $x\in V$
there exists an arbitrarily small neigborhood $U$ such that each orbit of $\Gamma$ intersects $U$ in a pathwise connected subset, then the group
acts regurarly.
\end{definition}
\ES{Think of regular versus semi-regular action as the group orbits being circles versus filling a 2-torus. I'll try to find a specific example of semiregular action.}

Thus $\Sigma=\SOn{2}$ acts regurarly on $V_R$ but not on $\Rls{5}$. For groups acting regularly we can define a cross-section for the group orbits.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:cross-section}
\index{cross-section}
Let $\Gamma$ act regularly on a $n$-dimensional manifold $V$ with $r$-dimensional orbits. Define a (local) \emph{cross-section}
to be an $(m-r)$-dimensional submanifold $K$ of $V$ such that $K$ intersects each orbit transversally and at most once.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[\cite{OlverInv}]
 If a Lie group $\Gamma$ acts regularly on a manifold $V$, then one can construct a local cross-section
 passing through any point $x\in V$.
\end{proposition}

A cross-section $K$ can be defined by means of level sets of functions $K_i(x)=c_i$, where $x\in V$ and $i=1,\ldots,r$. If the $K_i(x)$
coincide with the local coordinates $x_i$ on the manifold $V$, \ie~$K_i(x)=x_i$, then we call $K$ a \emph{coordinate cross
section}. In our example we can define a coordinate cross-section for the action of $\Sigma=\SOn{2}$ on $\Rls{5}\backslash\{x_1=x_2=y_1=y_2=0\}$  by, for instance, $x_1=0$.

We can now construct a moving frame for the action \refneq{eq:SO2act} of $SO(2)$ as follows. We write out explicitly the
group transformations:
\beq
\begin{split}
 	\overline{x}_1 &= x_1 \cos\theta - x_2 \sin\theta\cont
	\overline{x}_2 &= x_1 \sin\theta + x_2 \cos\theta\cont
	\overline{y}_1 &= y_1 \cos\theta - y_2 \sin\theta\cont
	\overline{y}_2 &= y_1 \sin\theta + y_2 \cos\theta\cont	
	\overline{z} &= z\,.
	\label{eq:CLEexplSO2}
\end{split}
\eeq
Then make $\overline{x}$ equal to the constant in the choice of cross-section, \ie~set $\overline{x}=0$. Thus, we can solve
the first of \refeq{eq:CLEexplSO2} for the group parameter $\theta$ and substitute in the remaining equations. We get
\beq
\begin{split}
	\theta &= 2 \tan^{-1}\frac{-x_2+\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}}{x_1} \cont
	\overline{x}_2 &= \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2} \cont
	\overline{y}_1 &= \frac{x_2 y_1-x_1 y_2}{\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}}\cont
	\overline{y}_2 &=\frac{x_1 y_1+x_2 y_2}{\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}}\,.
	\label{eq:invLaser}
\end{split}
\eeq
\ES{The solution $\theta = 2 \tan^{-1}\frac{-x_2+\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}}{x_1}$ was returned by Mathematica. If we use
$\theta = \arctan\frac{x_2}{x_1}$ our results are multiplied by $sgn(x_2)$.} We notice that $\overline{x}_2,\overline{y}_1,
\overline{y}_2,\overline{z}$ are $SO(2)$
invariant. In fact they are the \emph{fundamental invariants} for our problem: any other invariant can be expressed
as a function of $\overline{x}_2,\overline{y}_1, \overline{y}_2,\overline{z}$ and they are functionally independent.
Thus they serve to distinguish orbits in the neighborhood of the cross-section, \ie~two points lie on the same group
orbit if and only if all the fundamental invariants agree.

 The \emph{normalization} procedure for the computation of invariants applied in the example of $SO(2)$ can be applied
in much more general situations as follows. Assume $\Gamma$ acts (locally) freely on X and
thus $\Gamma$-orbits have the same dimension as $\Gamma$, say $r$. Choose a coordinate cross-section $K=\{x_1=c_1,\ldots,x_r=c_r\}$.
defined by the first $r$ coordinates (relabel coordinates as necessary.) Introduce local coordinates $g=(g_1,\ldots,g_r)$ on $\Gamma$ in
the neighborhood of the identity. Write out explicitly the group transformations:
\beq
	\overline{x}= g.x = w(g,x)\,.
	\label{eq:transNorm}
\eeq
Equating the first $r$ components of the function $w$ to the constants in the definition of the cross-section $K_i(x)=c_i$ yields the \emph{normalization equations} for $K$:
\beq
	\overline{x}_1=w_1(g,x)=c_1,\ldots,\overline{x}_r=w_r(g,x)=c_r\,.
	\label{eq:normalization}
\eeq
From the definition of cross-section and the Implicit Function Theorem the normalization equations \refneq{eq:normalization} can always be solved for the group parameters in terms of $x$, yielding the \emph{moving frame} associated with $K$: $g=\gamma(x)$. Substitution
of the moving frame equation back to \refeq{eq:transNorm} will yield the $n-r$ fundamental invariants. For proof \cf~\refrefs{FelsOlver98,FelsOlver99}.

The power of the method shows in the calculation of invariants for groups acting on a high-dimensional space. For example the
task of computing invariants for the standard action of $\SOn{2}$ on $\Clx{n}\cong\Rls{2n}$ defined by
\beq
	\left(\barr{cc} \overline{b}_k \\ \overline{c}_k\earr \right)=\left(\barr{cc}
			    			\cos(k\theta) & -\sin(k\theta)\\
						\sin(k\theta) & \cos(k\theta)\\
			   			\earr\\	
						\right) \left(\barr{cc} b_k \\ c_k\earr\right)\,,\ \ k=1,\ldots n\,.
	\label{eq:SO2stand}
\eeq
with $b_k,c_k\in\Rls{}$. The Gr\"{o}bner basis methods usually perform poorly as $n$ becomes larger than six\ES{I need to quote
the literature or try it to fully justify this.}. On a 1GHz Pentium III processor the fundamental invariants for $n=16$, for the cross
section $b_1=0$, were computed in approximately 130s. Most importantly the time was mostly
spend in simplification of expressions.
If one only wants to project equivariant dynamics on the \reducedsp\ then the moving frame method,
through its geometric interpretation, can be used to perform the projection without explicit knowledge of the fundamental invariants.
This idea will become clear in the example of \reducedsp\ projection
for \CLe.\ES{refer to appropriate section when written.} The fundamental invariants for \SOn{2} acting as in \refeq{eq:SO2stand} with
$n=6$ calculated with the method of moving frames are listed in \reftab{tab:SO2n6}. Notice another advantage of the method: no syzygies are present\ES{Well, I don't think one can notice it, but it is proved, so we are happy.}.
