% \section{Symmetries imply possible existence of \rpo s}
% \label{sec:SymRPO}

In a dynamical system $\dot{a} = v(a)$ with a strange invariant set, there exist
infinitely many periodic orbits
\[ f^\period{}(a) = a \]
characterized by period $\period{}$, which are dense within the invariant set.
Here $f^t$ is the flow map of the flow $v$, \ie, $a(t) = f^t(a)$ is the
solution of the flow $v$ with initial condition $a(0) = a$.

Let the dynamical system have symmetries represented by the operators
$\Sigma_{k,s}$, where $k \in {\cal K} \subset \mathbb{Z}^p$ are
parameters of discrete symmetries and $s \in {\cal S} \subset \mathbb{R}^q$
are parameters of continuous symmetries.  In other words,
\[ f^t(\Sigma_{k,s} a) = \Sigma_{k,s} f^t(a)\,. \]
In this case it is likely that, in addition to \po s, the dynamical system also
has \rpo s, characterized by the condition
\[ \Sigma_{k,s}f^\period{}(a) = a\,, \]
where, in addition to the period $\period{}$, the \rpo\ is also characterized by
the symmetry parameters $k$ and/or $s$.

In fact, if the symmetry is continuous, then it is much more likely
to find \rpo s, than it is to find exact \po s, since $s = 0$,
corresponding to the \po , is only one specific value in the
continuum of possible values of parameter $s$.

In the case of KS equation, which has continuous symmetry
$\Shift_{\shift/L}$ and discrete symmetry $\Refl$, it is possible to
find \rpo s that satisfy one of the following conditions
\[
  \Shift_{\shift/L}f^\period{}(a) = a\,,
\quad\mbox{or}\quad
  \Refl\Shift_{\shift/L}f^\period{}(a) = a\,.
\]
The first condition is satisfied by \rpo s with shift $\shift$,
while \rpo s that satisfy the second condition are exactly periodic
($\shift = 0$) with period $2\period{}$.
