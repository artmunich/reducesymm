Edward Lorenz arrived at the equation
\index{Lorenz flow}\index{Rayleigh-Benard flow}
\beq
\dot{\ssp}=\pVeloc(\ssp)
    =
    \left[
        \begin{array}{c}
\dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \\ \dot{z}
    \end{array}
    \right]

    \left[

\rho x - y -xz \\
xy -bz
    \end{array}
    \right]
\ee{Lorenz}
by a drastic simplification of
the Rayleigh-Benard flow. %\rf{lorenz63}.
Lorenz fixed
$\sigma = 10$, $ b= 8/3$,
and varied the ``Rayleigh number'' $\rho$. For
$0 < \rho < 1$ the \eqv\ $\EQV{0} =(0,0,0)$
at the origin is attractive.
At $ \rho = 1$  it undergoes a pitchfork
bifurcation into a pair of \eqva\ at
\index{equilibrium!Lorenz flow}
\beq
\ssp_{\EQV{1,2}} = (\pm \sqrt{b(\rho-1)}, \pm \sqrt{b(\rho-1)}, \rho-1)
\,,
\ee{LorEqva}
We shall not explore the Lorenz flow dependence on the $\rho$
parameter in what follows, but here is a brief synopsis: the
$\EQV{0}$  $1$\dmn\ unstable manifold closes into a
homoclinic orbit at $\rho=13.56\dots$. Beyond that, an infinity
of associated \po s are generated, until $\rho = 24.74\dots$,
where $\EQV{1,2}$ undergo a Hopf bifurcation.

All computations that follow
will be performed for the Lorenz parameter choice
\(
    \sigma = 10, b= 8/3, \rho = 28
\,.
\)
For these parameter values the long-time dynamics is confined to
the strange attractor
depicted in  \reffig{LorenzAttrct}.

$\EQV{1,2}$ are centers of out-spirals, and close to them  the
section % $\PoincS$ is transverse to the flow. However, close
to  $\EQV{0}$ trajectories pass the $z$-axis either by crossing
the section $\PoincS$ or staying on the viewer's side. We are
free to deploy as many sections as we wish: in order to capture
the whole flow in this neighborhood we add the second
Poincar\'e section, $\PoincS'$, through the $y=-x$ diagonal and
the $z$-axis. Together the two sections,
\reffig{fig:LorenzSect}\,(b), capture the whole flow near
$\EQV{0}$. In contrast to R\"ossler sections of

(continued from \refexam{exmp:RossLinrz}.)~~
A glance at \reffig{fig:LorenzSect} suggests that the
flow is organized by its 3 \eqva, so lets have a closer look at
their stable/unstable manifolds.

\PC{ChaosBook: add pointer}
The $\EQV{0}$ \eqv\  {\stabmat} \refeq{RossLinrz}
evaluated at $\ssp_{\EQV{0}} =(0,0,0)$ is block-diagonal.
The $z$-axis is an eigen\-vector
with a contracting eigenvalue $\eigExp[2]=-b$.
From \refeq{trA-Lorenz} it follows that all $[x,y]$ areas
shrink at rate $-(\sigma +1)$. Indeed, the
$[x,y]$ submatrix
\beq
{\Mvar^{-}} =
  \left(\barr{cc}
    -\sigma  & \sigma  \\
    \rho     &   -1
    \earr\right)
\ee{LorzEQ0plus}
has a real expanding/contracting eigenvalue pair
$\eigExp[1,3]=
-(\sigma +1)/2 \pm \sqrt{(\sigma-1)^2/4 + \rho \sigma}$,
with the right eigen\-vectors $\jEigvec[1]$,  $\jEigvec[3]$
in the $[x,y]$ plane, given by (either) column of
the projection operator
\PC{ChaosBook: give refeq here}
\beq
{\PP_i} = \frac{\Mvar^{-} -\eigExp[j] \matId}{\eigExp[{i}]-\eigExp[{j}]}
 = \frac{1}{\eigExp[{i}]-\eigExp[{j}]}
  \left(\barr{cc}
    -\sigma  - \eigExp[{j}] & \sigma  \\
                 \rho   &   -1-\eigExp[{j}]
    \earr\right)
  \,,\qquad i \neq j \in \{1,3\}
  \,.
\ee{LorzEQ0eVect}


$\EQV{1,2}$ \eqva\ have no symmetry, so
their eigenvalues are given by
the roots of a cubic equation, the secular determinant
$\det(\Mvar - \Lyap  \matId)=0$:
\beq
% \EQV{0}~~ &:& \;\; (\eigExp[+],\Lyap_-,\Lyap_s)
%    =  (-(\sigma +1)/2 \pm \sqrt{(\sigma-1)^2/4 + \rho \sigma}, -b)
% \EQV{1,2} &:&  \;\;   \mbox{}
     \Lyap^3+\Lyap^2(\sigma+b+1)+\Lyap b(\sigma+\rho)+2\sigma b (\rho-1) = 0
\,.
\label{LorenzEqQigs}
\eeq
For $\rho > 24.74$, $\EQV{1,2}$ have one stable real eigenvalue and
one unstable complex conjugate pair, % as solutions to \refeq{LorenzEqQigs},
leading to a spiral-out instability and the strange attractor
depicted in  \reffig{LorenzAttrct}.

As all numerical plots of the Lorenz flow are
here carried out for the Lorenz parameter choice
\(
    \sigma = 10, b= 8/3, \rho = 28
\,,
\)
we note the values of these eigenvalues for future reference,
\beq
\barr{lcrl}
\EQV{0}:~
(\eigExp[1],\eigExp[2], \eigExp[3])
    &=& (\,11.83\,,~-2.666,& -22.83\,)   \\
\EQV{1}:~
(\eigRe[1] \pm\,i\,\eigIm[1],\eigExp[3])
    &=& (\,\,0.094\,\pm i\,10.19,\,& -13.85\,) \,, \\
\earr
\label{EqLorenzStab}
\eeq
as
well as the rotation period
$T_{\EQV{1}} = 2\pi/\eigIm[1]$ about $\EQV{1}$,
and the  associated expansion/contraction multipliers
$\ExpaEig^{(i)} = \exp(\eigRe[j] T_{\EQV{1}})$
per a spiral-out turn:
\index{turnover time}
\index{time!turnover}
\beq
T_{\EQV{1}} =  0.6163 \,, \qquad
(\ExpaEig^{(1)},\ExpaEig^{(3)})
   = (\,1.060 \,, 1.957\times 10^{-4} \,)
\,.
\label{EqLorenzMltp}
\eeq
We learn that the typical turnover time scale in this problem is
of order $T \approx T_{\EQV{1}} \approx 1$
(and not, let us say, 1000, or $10^{-2}$). Combined with
the contraction rate \refeq{trA-Lorenz}, this tells us that
the Lorenz flow strongly contracts \statesp\ volumes, by factor of
$ \approx 10^{-4}$ per mean turnover time.

In the $\EQV{1}$ neighborhood the unstable manifold
trajectories slowly spiral out, with
very small radial  per-turn expansion multiplier
$\ExpaEig^{(1)} \simeq  1.06$,
and very strong contraction multiplier
$\ExpaEig^{(3)}  \simeq 10^{-4}$
onto the unstable manifold,
\reffig{fig:LorenzEQ1}\,(a).
This contraction confines, for all practical purposes,
the Lorenz attractor to a 2\dmn\ surface
evident in the section \reffig{fig:LorenzSect}.
    \PC{ChaosBook: develop this text from steady.tex:
        ``For an unstable complex pair $\eigExp[n,n+1]$ of \eqv\ $\EQV{}$,

by $\jEigvec[n]_{r}, \jEigvec[n]_{i}$.
This part of the \EQV{}\ unstable manifold is 2\dmn;
its shape can be traced out by computing a set of trajectories with initial
conditions
$\EQV{} + \epsilon (\jEigvec[n]_{r} \cos \theta + \jEigvec[n]_{i} \sin \theta)$
for a set of values of $\theta$.
%In practice, one obtains a more uniform

%along the stable eigen\-vector of $\EQV{1}$, $(0.8557, -0.3298, -0.3988) $.

In the $\ssp_{\EQV{0}} = (0,0,0)$ \eqv\ neighborhood the extremely strong
$\eigExp[3] \simeq -23$ contraction along the $\jEigvec[3]$ direction
confines the hyperbolic dynamics near $\EQV{0}$ to the plane
spanned by the unstable eigen\-vector $\jEigvec[1]$,
with $\eigExp[1] \simeq 12$, and
the slowest contraction rate eigen\-vector $\jEigvec[2]$
along the $z$-axis, with $\eigExp[2] \simeq - 3$.
In this plane the strong expansion % $\eigExp[1] \simeq 18$ % JFG: 12?
along $\jEigvec[1]$ overwhelms the
slow  $\eigExp[2] \simeq - 3$ contraction down the $z$-axis,
making it extremely unlikely for a random trajectory
to approach $\EQV{0}$, \reffig{fig:LorenzEQ1}\,(b).
Thus linearization suffices to describe analytically the singular
dip in the Poincar\'e sections of
\reffig{fig:LorenzSect}, and the empirical scarcity
of trajectories close to $\EQV{0}$.

As the $\EQV{1}$ unstable manifold spirals out,
the strip that starts out in the section above $\EQV{1}$
in \reffig{fig:LorenzSect} cuts across the
$z$-axis invariant subspace. This strip necessarily contains a
heteroclinic orbit that hits the $z$-axis
head on, and in infinite time (but exponentially
fast) descends all the way to $\EQV{0}$.
\PC{This needs more explaining. As
    $\EQV{0}$ has 2 contracting dimensions (and fluids will
    have 50,000), whole volumes get scrunched into $\EQV{0}$,
    not just 1\dmn\ heteroclinic orbits.
   }


How? As in the neighborhood of the
$\EQV{0}$ \eqv\ the dynamics is linear
(see \reffig{fig:LorenzEQ1}\,(a)), there
is no need to integrate numerically the final segment
of the heteroclinic
connection - it is sufficient to bring a trajectory
a small distance away from $\EQV{0}$, continue
analytically to a small distance
beyond $\EQV{0}$,
then resume the numerical integration.

What happens next? Trajectories to the left of $z$-axis shoot
off along the $\jEigvec[1]$ direction, and those to the
right along $-\jEigvec[1]$. As along the $\jEigvec[1]$ direction
$xy >0$, the nonlinear term in the $\dot{z}$ equation \refeq{Lorenz}
bends both branches of the
$\EQV{0}$ unstable manifold $W^u(\EQV{0})$ upwards.
Then $\ldots$ - never mind.
Best to postpone the completion of this narrative to
\refexam{exmp:LorenzD1}, where the discrete
symmetry of Lorenz flow will help us streamline the analysis.
As we shall show, what we already know about the 3 \eqva\ and
their stable/unstable manifolds suffices to completely pin down
the topology of Lorenz flow.

Lorenz equation \refeq{Lorenz} is invariant under
the action of order-2 group $\Ztwo = \{e,\Rot{1/2}\}$, where
 $\Rot{1/2}$ is $[x,y]$-plane, constant $z$  rotation by $\pi$ about the $z$-axis:
\beq
(x,y,z) \to \Rot{1/2}(x,y,z) = (-x,-y,z) \,.
\ee{LorenzR}
$(\Rot{1/2})^2=1$ condition decomposes the \statesp\ into two
linearly irreducible subspaces
$\pS = \pS^+ \oplus \pS^-$,
the $z$-axis $\pS^+$ and
the $[x,y]$ plane $\pS^-$, with
projection operators onto the two subspaces given by
(see \refsect{s:ProjOper})
 \beq
 \PP^+ = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \Rot{1/2})
 =   \left(\barr{ccc}
    0  &  0 & 0  \\
    0  &  0 & 0 \\
    0  &  0 & 1
    \earr\right)
     ,\quad
 \PP^- = \frac{1}{2}(1 - \Rot{1/2})
  =   \left(\barr{ccc}
    1  &  0 & 0  \\
    0  &  1 & 0 \\
    0  &  0 & 0
    \earr\right)
\,.
 \label{projOp:sig}
 \eeq
As the flow is $\Ztwo$-invariant, so is its linearization
$\dot{\ssp} = \Mvar \ssp$. Evaluated at $\EQV{0}$, $\Mvar$
commutes with  $\Rot{1/2}$, and,
as we have already seen in  \refexam{exmp:LorenzStab},
the $\EQV{0}$ {\stabmat}
decomposes into $[x,y]$ and $z$ blocks.

The 1\dmn\ $\pS^+$ subspace is
the fixed-point subspace of $\Ztwo$, with the $z$-axis
points left \emph{point-wise} invariant under the group
action
\beq
\mbox{Fix}(\Ztwo) =
   \{ \ssp \in \pS^+ : \mathbf{g} \, \ssp = \ssp \mbox{ for } g \in \{e,\Rot{1/2}\} \}
\,.
\ee{dscr:LorFPsubsp}
\PC{link to definitions in discrete.tex}
However, a point $\ssp(t)$ in $\mbox{Fix}(G)$ moves with time,
but remains within $\ssp(t) \subseteq \mbox{Fix}(G)$ for all
times; the  subspace $\pS^+ = \mbox{Fix}(G)$ is {\em flow
invariant}. In case at hand this jargon is a bit of an
overkill: clearly for $(x,y)=(0,0)$ the full \statesp\ Lorenz
equation \refeq{Lorenz} is reduced to the exponential
contraction to the $\EQV{0}$ \eqv,
\PC{pointer to turbulence chapter here}
\beq
\dot{z} = -b \, z
\,.
\ee{LorenzZaxis}
% which is the reason why you never see this decomposition discussed
% in literature. Even though
However, for flows in higher-dimensional \statesp s the
flow-invariant $\pS^+$ subspace can itself be high-dimensional, with
interesting dynamics of its own.
Even in this simple case this subspace plays an important role
as a topological obstruction, with
the number of winds of a trajectory around it providing
a natural symbolic dynamics.

The $\pS^-$ subspace is, however, {\em not} flow-invariant, as the nonlinear
terms $\dot{z}=xy - bz$ in the Lorenz equation \refeq{Lorenz}
send all initial conditions within
$\pS^-=(x(0),y(0),0)$ into the full, $z(t) \neq 0$ \statesp\  $\pS$.
The $\Rot{1/2}$ symmetry is nevertheless very useful.

By taking as a Poincar\'e section % $\PoincS$
any  $\Rot{1/2}$-invariant, infinite-extent, non-self-inter\-sect\-ing
surface that contains the
$z$ axis, the \statesp\ is divided into a half-space fundamental
domain $\tilde{\pS}=\pS/\Ztwo$ and its $180^o$ rotation $\Rot{1/2}\tilde{\pS}$.
An example is afforded by the $\PoincS$ plane section of
the Lorenz flow in \reffig{fig:LorenzSect}. Take
the  fundamental domain $\tilde{\pS}$ to be the half-space between the
viewer and $\PoincS$. Then the full Lorenz
flow is captured by re-injecting back into $\tilde{\pS}$
any trajectory that exits it, by a rotation of $\pi$ around the $z$ axis.

As any such $\Rot{1/2}$-invariant section does the job, a
choice of a `fundamental domain' is here largely mater of
taste. For purposes of visualization it is convenient to make
the double-cover nature of the full \statesp\ by $\tilde{\pS}$
explicit, through any \statesp\ redefinition that maps a pair
of points related by symmetry into a single point. In case at
hand, this can be easily accomplished by expressing $(x,y)$ in
polar coordinates $(x,y) \,=\, (r \cos \theta , r \sin
\theta)$, and then plotting the flow in the
\emph{`doubled-polar angle representation:'}
\beq
(x',y') \,=\, (r \cos 2\theta , r \sin 2\theta)
        \,=\, ( (x^2-y^2)/r, 2xy/r )
\,,
\label{doubledPolar}
\eeq
as in \reffig{fig:PolarLorenz}\,(a). In contract to the
original $G$-equivariant coordinates $[x,y,z]$, the Lorenz flow
expressed in the new coordinates $[x',y',z]$ is {\em
$G$-invariant}, see \refexam{exmp:3dPolyDscr}. In this
representation the $\tilde{\pS}=\pS/\Ztwo$ fundamental domain
flow is a smooth, continuous flow, with  (any choice of) the
fundamental domain stretched out to seamlessly  cover the
entire $[x',y']$ plane.

We emphasize: such nonlinear coordinate transformations are
\emph{not} required to implement the symmetry quotienting
$\pS/G$, unless there are computational gains in a nonlinear
coordinate change suggested by the symmetry. We offer them here
only as a visualization aid that might help the reader
disentangle 2\dmn\ projections of higher-dimensional flows. All
numerical calculations are usually carried in the initial, full
\statesp\ formulation of a flow, with symmetry-related points
identified by \emph{linear} symmetry transformations.

%from ChaosBook.org \Chapter{knead}{19feb2009}{Charting the state space}

We start in \refsect{s-symb-dyn} with a simple and intuitive
example, a 3-disk game of pinball. The qualitative dynamics of
stretching/shrinking strips of surviving \statesp\ regions
enables us to partition the {\statesp} and  assign
\emph{symbolic dynamics} itineraries to trajectories. For the
3-disk game of pinball all possible symbol sequences enumerate
all possible orbits.

In \refsect{s:StrtchFld} we use R\"ossler and Lorenz flows to
motivate modeling of higher-dimensional flows by iteration of
1-dimensional maps. For these two flows the 1-dimensional maps
capture essentially all of the higher-dimensional flow
dynamics, both qualitatively and quantitatively. 1-dimensional
maps suffice to explain the two key aspects of qualitative
dynamics; \emph{temporal ordering}, or \emph{itinerary} with
which a trajectory visits \statesp\ regions%
% (\refsect{s-Unimod-symb-dyn})
, and the \emph{spatial ordering}
between trajectory points % (\refsect{s-Spat-ord})%
, which is the
key to determining the admissibility of an orbit with a
prescribed itinerary. In a generic dynamical system not every
symbol sequence is realized as a dynamical trajectory; as one
looks further and further, one discovers more and more rules
which prohibit families of itineraries. For 1-dimensional
\stretchf\ maps the \emph{kneading theory} % (\refsect{s-knead})
provides the definitive answer as to which temporal itineraries
are {\em \admissible} as trajectories of the dynamical system.



{\bf From $d$-dimensional flows to 1-dimensional maps}

Symbolic dynamics for the $3$-disk game of pinball is so
straight\-forward that one may altogether fail to see the
connection between the topology of hyperbolic flows and their
symbolic dynamics. This is brought out more
clearly by the 1-dimensional visualization of \stretchf\ flows
to which we turn now.

So a typical dynamical system
that we care about is {\em bounded}. If the price to keep going
is high - for example, we try to stir up some tar, and observe
it come to a dead stop the moment we cease our labors - the
dynamics tends to settle into a simple state. However,
as the resistance to change decreases - the tar is heated up
and we are more vigorous in our stirring - the dynamics becomes
unstable.



You get the idea - R\"ossler flow winds around the stable manifold of the
`central' \eqv, stretches and folds, and  the
flow can be reduced to a 1-dimensional map. The next example is
similar, but the folding mechanism is very different: the unstable
manifold of one of the \eqva\ collides with the stable manifold
of the other one, forcing a robust {\em heteroclinic
connection} between the two.

We now deploy the symmetry of Lorenz flow
to streamline and complete analysis of the Lorenz strange attractor
commenced in  \refexam{exmp:LorenzD1}. There we showed that
the dihedral $D_1 = \{e,R\}$ symmetry identifies the
two \eqva\ $\EQV{1}$ and $\EQV{2}$,
and the traditional `two-eared' Lorenz flow
\reffig{LorenzAttrct} is replaced by
the `single-eared' \PublicPrivate{}{Van Gogh} flow
of \reffig{fig:PolarLorenz}\,(a).
Furthermore, symmetry identifies two sides of any plane
through the $z$ axis, replacing a full-space Poincar\'e
section plane by a half-plane, and the two directions
of a full-space eigen\-vector of $\EQV{0}$
 by a one-sided eigen\-vector, see \reffig{fig:PolarLorenz}\,(a).

\refExam{exmp:LorenzGlob} explained the genesis of the
$\ssp_{\EQV{1}}$ {\eqv} unstable manifold, its orientation and
thickness, its collision with the $z$-axis, and its
heteroclinic connection to the $\ssp_{\EQV{0}} = (0,\, 0,\, 0)$
{\eqv}. All that remains is to describe how the $\EQV{0}$
neighborhood connects back to the $\EQV{1}$ unstable
manifold. \refFig{fig:PolarLorenz} now shows clearly how the
Lorenz dynamics is pieced together from the 2 \eqva\ and their
unstable manifolds:

Having completed the descent to  $\EQV{0}$, the
infinitesimal neighborhood of the heteroclinic $\EQV{1} \to
\EQV{0}$ trajectory is ejected along the unstable manifold
of $\EQV{0}$ and is re-injected into the unstable manifold
of $\EQV{1}$. Both sides of the narrow strip enclosing the
$\EQV{0}$ unstable manifold  lie above it, and they get
folded onto each other with a knife-edge crease (contracted
exponentially for infinite time to the  $\EQV{0}$
heteroclinic point), with the heteroclinic out-trajectory
defining the outer edge of the strange attractor. This leads to
the folding of the outer branch of the Lorenz strange
attractor, illustrated in \reffig{fig:PoincLorenz}\,(b), with
the outermost edge following the unstable manifold of
$\EQV{0}$.

Now the stage is set for construction of  Poincar\'e sections
and associated  Poincar\'e return maps. There are two natural
choices; the section at $\EQV{0}$, lower part of
\reffig{fig:PoincLorenz}\,(b), and the section (blue) above
$\EQV{1}$. The first section, together with the blowup of
the $\EQV{0}$ neighborhood, \reffig{fig:LorenzEQ1}\,(b),
illustrates clearly the scarcity of trajectories (vanishing
natural measure) in the neighborhood of $\EQV{0}$. The flat
section above $\EQV{1}$ (which is, believe it or not, a
smooth conjugacy by the flow of the knife-sharp section at
$\EQV{0}$) is more convenient for our purposes. Its return
map  \refeq{orientCond} is given by \reffig{fig:RetMapLorenz}.

The rest is straight sailing: to accuracy $10^{-4}$ the return
map is unimodal, its critical point's forward trajectory
yields the \ks\ \refeq{e_kappa_def}, and the \admissible\ binary
sequences, so any number of periodic points  can be accurately
determined from this 1-dimensional return map, and the 3\dmn\
cycles then verified by integrating the Lorenz differential
equations \refeq{Lorenz}. The map is everywhere expanding on
the strange attractor, so it is no wonder mathematicians can
here make the ergodicity rigorous.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

What have we learned from the above two exemplary 3-dimensional
flows? If a flow is locally unstable but globally bounded, any
open ball of initial points will be stretched out and then
folded back. If the \eqva\ are hyperbolic, the trajectories
will be attracted along some eigen-directions and ejected along
others. The unstable manifold of one \eqv\ can avoid stable
manifolds of other \eqva, as is the case for R\"ossler, or
slice them head on, as is the case for Lorenz. Hence
qualitatively a typical trajectory will wander through
\statesp, being alternatively attracted into \eqva\
neighborhoods, and then ejected again. What is important is the
motion along the unstable manifolds --that is where
1-dimensional maps come from.

\remark{Symmetries of the Lorenz equation:}{ \label{rem:LorenzSymm}
(continued from \refrem{rem:Lorenz}.)
After having studied  \refexam{exmp:LorenzD1}
you will appreciate why {\tt ChaosBook.org}
starts out with the  symmetry-less
R\"ossler flow \refeq{Roesl_eq}, instead of the
better known Lorenz flow \refeq{Lorenz}
(indeed, getting rid of symmetry
was one of R\"ossler's motivations).
He threw the baby out with the water; for Lorenz flow
dimensionalities of stable/unstable manifolds
make possible a
robust heteroclinic connection absent from R\"ossler flow,
with unstable manifolds of an \eqv\ flowing into the
stable manifold of another \eqva.
How such connections are forced upon us is
best grasped by perusing the chapter 13 `Heteroclinic tangles'
of the inimitable
Abraham and Shaw illustrated classic\rf{abraham:shaw}.
Their beautiful hand-drawn sketches elucidate the origin
of heteroclinic connections in the Lorenz flow (and its high-dimensional
Navier-Stokes relatives) better than any computer simulation.
Miranda and Stone\rf{GL-Mir93} were first to
quotient the $\Ztwo$ symmetry and explicitly construct
the desymmetrized, `proto-Lorenz system,'
by a nonlinear coordinate transformation into the Hilbert-Weyl
polynomial basis
invariant under the action of the symmetry group%
\rf{CoLiSh96}.
For in-depth discussion of symmetry-reduced (`images')
and symmetry-extended (`covers')
topology, symbolic dynamics, periodic orbits,
invariant polynomial bases \etc, of
Lorenz, R\"ossler and many other low-dimensional systems
there is
no better reference than the
Gilmore and Letellier monograph\rf{GL-Gil07b,GL-Let01}.
%
They interpret the proto-Lorenz and its `double
cover' Lorenz as `intensities' being
the squares of `amplitudes,' and call quotiented
flows such as (Lorenz)/$\Ztwo$ `images.'
Our `doubled-polar angle' visualization
\reffig{fig:PoincLorenz}
is a proto-Lorenz in disguise, with the difference: we
integrate the flow and construct Poincar\'e sections and
return maps in the Lorenz $[x,y,z]$ coordinates, without
any nonlinear coordinate transformations.
The Poincar\'e
return map \reffig{fig:RetMapLorenz} is reminiscent
in shape both of the one given by Lorenz
in his original paper, and the one plotted in
a radial coordinate by Gilmore and Letellier.
Nevertheless, it is profoundly different:
our return maps are
from unstable manifold $\to$ itself\rf{CCP96},
and thus intrinsic and coordinate independent. This is necessary
in high-dimensional flows
to avoid problems such as double-valuedness of return map projections
on arbitrary 1\dmn\ coordinates encountered already in
the R\"ossler example. More importantly, as we know the embedding
of the unstable manifold into the full \statesp, a periodic point
of our return map \emph{is} - regardless of the
length of the cycle -  the periodic point in the full  \statesp,
so no additional Newton searches are needed.

Chapter 3 of Rebecca Hoyle\rf{hoyll06} is a very
student-friendly overview of all of the group theory
a nonlinear dynamicist might need, with exception of
quotienting, reduction of dynamics to fundamental domains
which is not discussed at all. Curiously, we have not read any of the
group theory books that she recommends as background reading,
which just confirms that there are too many group theory books in all.
For example, one that you will not find useful at all is
\refref{GroupThe}. The reason is presumably that in physics (where
much of the modern group theory was first formulated)
the focus is on the linear representations used in
quantum mechanics, crystallography and quantum field theory.
We shall need these techniques in
\refChap{c-symm} where we reduce the
linear action of evolution operators to irreducible subspaces.
However, here we are looking at nonlinear dynamics, and the
emphasis is on the symmetries of orbits, their isotropy-group
reductions, and the isotypic decomposition of their linear
stability matrices.

was the 1896 short note by Poincar\'e\rf{Poinc1896},
in the context of the 3-body problem.
\Reqva\ of the $N$-body problem
(known in this context as the Lagrange points, stationary in
the co-rotating frame) are circular motions in the inertial frame,
and {\rpo s} correspond to quasiperiodic motions in the inertial frame.
In the planar $N$-body problem the equations are unchanged by
rotations. \Reqva\ can exist in a rotating frame,
and are called central configurations.
For \rpo s in celestial mechanics see also \refref{Broucke75}.
However, according to
Cushman, Bates\rf{CushBat97} and Yoder\rf{Yode88},
C. Huygens\rf{Huyg1673} understood the \reqva\ of a
spherical pendulum many
years before publishing them in 1673.

Lan has some relative equilibria (traveling waves) for KS in his
thesis\rf{Lan:Thesis}, %http://chaosbook.org/projects/theses.html
 and for complex LG in a paper on ``MAWs.''
Viswanath\rf{ViswanathPC06} % arXiv.org/physics/0604062
found them in the plane Couette problem.
Siminos and Davidchack have for box size $L=22$ some equilibria.
Striking application of \rpo s has been the discovery
of ``choreographies" of $N$-body problems%
\rf{CheMon00,CGMS02,McCordMontaldi}.

\remark{Stability ordering.}{
The stability ordering was introduced by
Dahlqvist and Russberg\rf{DR91} in a study of chaotic dynamics for the
$(x^2y^2)^{1/a}$ potential.
%in the quantum case.
The presentation here runs along the lines of
Dettmann and Morriss\rf{DM97} for the Lorentz gas
which is hyperbolic but the symbolic dynamics is highly pruned, and
Dettmann and Cvitanovi\'c\rf{DC98} for a family of intermittent maps.
In
%all of
the
%above
applications discussed in the above papers, the stability ordering
yields a considerable improvement over the topological length
ordering. In quantum chaos applications cycle expansion cancelations
are affected by the phases of pseudocycles (their actions), hence
{\em period ordering} rather than stability is frequently employed.

\remark{Surveys of rigorous theory.}{ \label{rem:rig-z}
We recommend the references listed in \refrem{s-GuideLit}
for an introduction to
the mathematical literature on this subject.
For a physicist, Driebe's monograph\rf{Driebe99}
might be the most accessible
introduction into mathematics discussed briefly in this chapter.
There are a number of reviews of the mathematical approach to
\dzeta s and \Fd s, with pointers to the original references,
such as \refrefs{Viv-1,Poll-1}. An alternative approach to spectral
properties of the \FPoper\ is given in \refref{Via-1}.

Ergodic theory, as presented by Sinai\rf{er-sinai} and others,
tempts one to describe the densities on which the \evOper\ acts
in terms of either
integrable or square-integrable functions. For our
purposes, as we have already seen,
this space is not suitable.
An introduction to ergodic theory is given by
Sinai, Kornfeld and Fomin\rf{Korn}; more advanced
old-fashioned  presentations are Walters\rf{Walt82}
and Denker, Grillenberger and Sigmund\rf{DGS76}; and a more formal
one is given by Peterson\rf{Peterson}.
        %\MAP{  Warwick Tucker
W.~Tucker\rf{tucker1,tucker2,MIViana} has proven rigorously via interval
     arithmetic that the Lorentz attractor is strange for
     the original parameters, and has a long stable periodic orbit for
     the slightly different parameters.
