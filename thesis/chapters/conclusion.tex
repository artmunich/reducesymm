This thesis contribution to the dynamical system's approach to turbulence is
setting up a framework for identifying and organizing recurrent patterns when there
is a continuous symmetry in the system. This is done with the following constraints
in mind: 1) high-dimensionality of phase space, 2) rewriting the equations of motion
is inpractical, 3) reduction can be local but the local pieces have to be joined together
in a way that the global geometry of the attractor is elucidated.

Reduction is performed along two axes: visualization and construction of return maps.
For visualization purposes the method of moving frames is efficient in providing 
symbolic expressions for invariants up to moderate dimension. The inevitable singularities
in those invariants can be removed in an algorithmic manner and one can then map the
solutions to the invariants, rather than rewriting the equations. The visualizations
we get this way help us identify the dynamically important solution and the role they
play in organizing the flow and lead to an informed choice of local Poincar\'e sections
that capture the dynamics of the important unstable manifolds.

This leads us to the next step, which is reduction using the geometrical interpretation
of moving frames as a group operation that brings points back to a local cross-section to the
group orbits. This is a linear operation for any given point and can be implemented efficiently
even for high-dimensional discretezations of PDEs. The crucial step is to avoid transformation
singularities by restricting attention to local, group-invariant, Poincar\'e sections that
do not contain any points on which the transformations become singular.

Application of this procedure to \CLe\ leads to significant simplification of the phase portraits
but most importantly it reduces the 5-dimensional dynamics to an 1-dimensional return map that enables us to systematically label and determine all relative periodic orbits up to a given period. Application
to \KS\ equation helped reveal the importance of relative equilibria in organizing the flow and helped piece together the different invariant objects that ``triangulate'' the geometry of the attractor.
Moreover, the ground is set up for future work to proceed beyond the visualization stage to the construction of return (or forward) maps that will provide a concrete description of the dynamics
and will allow quantitative calculations by means of cycle expansions.

Returning to the description of the dynamicist's view of turbulence we note that if we are to
interpret turbulence as a walk through unstable recurrent patterns then this thesis provides
a framework to recognize a pattern irrespective of its location, in much the same way as our brain
does\ES{Mention applications of moving coframes to vision recognition here?}.
