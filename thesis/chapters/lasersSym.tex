\CLe\ were introduced by Gibbon and McGuinness\rf{GibMcCLE82} as a low-dimensional model
of baroclinic instability in the atmosphere.
As the name suggest the equations turned out to be a complex generalization
of Lorenz equations:
\beq
\index{Complex Lorenz equations}
\begin{split}
 \dot{x} &=-\sigma x+ \sigma y \,,\\
 \dot{y} &=(r-z)x-a y \,,\\
 \dot{z} &= \frac{1}{2}\left(x \bar{y}+\bar{x}y\right)-b z\,,
 \label{eq:CLe}
\end{split}
\eeq
where now $X,Y$ are complex variables, $Z$ is real, while the parameters $\sigma,\,b$ are real and $r=r_1+i r_2$, $a=1-i e$ are
complex. In the special case $r_2=0, e\neq0$, complex Lorenz equations also appear as a truncation of Maxwell-Bloch equations describing detuned lasers\rf{BakasovAbraham93}
	\ES{This is were the correspondance is established in a satisfactory manner, while criticising the choice of Ning and Haken\rf{NingHakenCLE90} to
		take $r_2=-e$.}
.
As allready noted \CLe\ is equivariant under the action \refneq{eq:RotCLe} of $\SOn{2}$. 
Here we consider the $\SOn{2}$-equivariant \CLe\ \refneq{eq:CLe}
introduced in \refsect{sect:CLe}. We rewrite the system in
real variables $x=x_1+ i\, x_2\,,\ y=y_1+i\, x_2$ as
\beq
\begin{split}
	\dot{x}_1 &= -\sigma x_1 + \sigma y_1\cont
	\dot{x}_2 &= -\sigma x_2 + \sigma y_2\cont
	\dot{y}_1 &= (r_1-z) x_1 - r_2 x_2 -y_1-e y_2 \cont
	\dot{y}_2 &= r_2 x_1 + (r_1-z) x_2 + e y_1- y_2\cont
	\dot{z} &= -b z + x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2\,.
	\label{eq:CLeR}
\end{split}
\eeq
The \stabmat\ is
  \beq
{\Mvar_{CLe}} =
  \left(\barr{ccccc}
    -\sigma    	& 0 		& \sigma & 0    &  0 \\
	0 	& -\sigma       & 0      & -\sigma   &  0 \\
	r_1-z  &     -r_2      & -1     & -e & -x_1 \\
	r_2     & r_1-z       	& e  	& -1       & -x_2 \\
	y_1     & y_2           & x_1    & x_2      & -b
    \earr\right)
\,.
  \ee{CLeStabMat}
The origin is a \eqv\ of \refeq{eq:CLeR} for any value of the parameters. As shown in
\refref{FowlerCLE82} it is stable for $0<r_1<r_{1c}$ and unstable for $r_{1c}<r_1$, where
\beq
	r_{1c} = 1 + \frac{(e+r_2)(e-\sigma r_2)}{(\sigma+1)^2}\,.
\eeq
At bifurcation a pair of eigenvalues crosses the imaginary axis with imaginary part:
\beq
	\omega_c = \frac{\sigma (e + r_2)}{\sigma+1}\,.
	\label{eq:omegaCLE}
\eeq

Thus we can expect that after a center manifold or Liapunov-Schmidt reduction one
can apply the equivariant Hopf bifurcation theorem\ES{state it in appropriate section,
refer to it.} with $\SOn{2}$ symmetry thus
concluding the existence of a \reqv\ after bifurcation\ES{I'll do this
if I have time.}. In \refref{FowlerCLE82} the authors perform a direct bifurcation analysis and
show that, for $e+r_2\neq 0$, a Hopf cycle is created that also turns out to be an \SOn{2}-orbit,
\ie\ a \reqv. For $e+r_2=0$ the cycle degenerates to an \SOn{2}-orbit of \eqv\ $E_1$,
since $\omega_c =0$ and the conditions of equivariant Hopf theorem do not apply.

The secondary bifurcation from the \reqv\ is expected according to Krupa's theorem\ES{refer to it
when written up} to result in relative periodic orbits.
In the non-generic case of an \SOn{2}-orbit of \reqva\
it has been shown by Krupa that one gets bifurcation to periodic orbits. The secondary bifurcation has
been studied in \refref{NingHakenCLE90}.
    \ES{The results are messy and hard to comment on.
They show existence of supercritical and subcritical bifurcations. Will continue this discussion
later}

Ning and Haken\rf{NingHakenCLE90} have shown that certain semiclassical approximations
for single mode, detuned, ring lasers lead to equations isomorphic to \CLe. %with $x,y$ and $z$
%proportional to electric field, polarization and population inversion, respectively.
The authors in \refref{NingHakenCLE90}
make the choice $e+r_2=0$ so that a detuned stationary solution exists.\ES{This assumption is
questionable unless it is forced by the physics of the problem, which I cannot follow very
well. It leads to non-generic bifurcation behavior, while one would like a model of
a physical system to be robust under perturbations (of the model). Furthermore, the fact that the
Hopf cycle in the general case is an $\SOn{2}$-orbit has gone unnoticed. The \reqv\ can
be interpreted as an \eqv\ in a rotating frame and the measured electric field of the laser
would be the same in both cases.} Bakasov and Abraham\cite{BakasovAbraham93} criticize this approach
and show that one can use \CLe with $r_2=0$ and $e\neq0$ to describe detuned lasers.

\subsubsection{The $e=r_2=0$ case}

When one takes $e=r_2=0$ we immediately observe the real subspace $x_2=y_2=0$ is flow invariant
and the usual \Le\ are recovered. From equivariance, any subspace $U_\theta$ on the $\SOn{2}$-orbit of the real
subspace is invariant as well, for example the imaginary subspace $x_1=y_1=0$. The
$U_\theta$'s are  parameterized by the angle of \SOn{2} rotations with
the restriction $\theta\in[0,\pi)$. We demonstrate the situation for the standard \Le\ parameters
in \reffig{fig:LorenzCoex}. A continuum of identical, disjoint Lorenz ``butterfly'' attractors exists.

Yet, we cannot choose all initial conditions
in one of the flow invariant subspaces $U_\theta$. Indeed, if we use the real subspace
as reference we can choose coordinates $(x_1,y_1,z,\theta)$ for the subspace $U$ of \Rls{5}
foliated by the $U_\theta$'s, which makes it clear that this is a 4-dimensional subspace.
Points that do not lie on $U$ can be thought of as ``mis-rotated'': we start with a point on
the real subspace and rotate by an angle $\theta$ on the $(x_1,x_2)$-plane and by an
angle $\phi\neq\theta$ on the $(y_1,y_2)$ plane. One then would like to know where the asymptotic dynamics
for those initial conditions not in $U$ end up. Since the only \eqv\ of the equations are the origin
and the group orbit of \eqv\ $E_1$, we get the hint that the asymptotic dynamics has to be governed
by the stable and unstable manifolds of the same \eqva\ that govern dynamics in $U$.
To see whether this is true we examine the dot product of the vector field with the direction of
rotations of the system
% \beq
%   (x_2\ -x_1\ y_2\ -y_1)
%     \left(\barr{c}
% 	 -\sigma x_1 + \sigma y_1 \\
% 	 -\sigma x_2 + \sigma y_2 \\
% 	 (r_1-z) x_1 - r_2 x_2 -y_1-e y_2 \\
% 	 r_2 x_1 + (r_1-z) x_2 + e y_1- y_2\\
% 	 -b z + x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2\,.
%     \earr\right)
% \,.
% \eeq
\beq
	(\Lg.p).\vf(p) = \left(r_1-\sigma-z\right)\left(x_1 y_2 -x_2 y_1\right) -r_2\left(x_1 y_1+ x_2 y_2\right)- e\left(y_1^2+y_2^2\right)
	\label{eq:CLe0ip}
\eeq
where we have used $\Lg$, the Lie algebra generator of \SOn{2}, $p=(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2)$ and $\vf(p)$ the vector field in \refeq{eq:CLeR}.
We observe that for $e=r_2=0$ only $x_1 y_2-x_2 y_1$ and $z$ appear. By taking the time derivative of $x_1 y_2-x_2 y_1$ and using \refeq{eq:CLeR}
we can show that
\beq
	\frac{d}{dt}\left(x_1 y_2-x_2 y_1\right)= -(\sigma+1)\left(x_1 y_2-x_2 y_1\right)
\eeq
and, since $z$ is bounded, the inner product in \refeq{eq:CLe0ip} goes to zero as $t\rightarrow\infty$. Thus, asymptotically the vector
field along any trajectory becomes orthogonal to the direction of infinitesimal rotations and the dynamics approach one of the $U_\theta$'s.
This is demonstrated in \reffig{fig:CLe0trans}.

One approach to orbit space reduction is by rewriting the dynamics in
terms of invariant polynomials, following Gilmore and Letellier\rf{GL-Gil07b}:
\beq
\begin{split}
	u_1 &= x_1^2+x_2^2 \cont
	u_2 &= y_1^2+y_2^2 \cont
	u_3 &= x_1 y_2-x_2 y_1\cont
	u_4 &= x_1 y_1+x_2 y_2\cont
	u_5 &= z\,.
	\label{eq:ipLaser}
\end{split}
\eeq
These polynomials are linearly independent, but functionally related by the syzygy
\beq
 	u_1u_2 -u_3^2-u_4^2 =0\,.
	\label{eq:syzLaser}
\eeq
Projections of the dynamics on the $u_i$'s are shown in \reffig{fig:CLEip}. In most projections
the folding mechanism is hidden since the dynamics is squeezed near the $z$-axis.
    \PC{not sure "tearing mechanism" of Gilmore is a good term - noting is
        torn, it is continuously stretched and then folded with sharp heteroclinic
        connection edge. {\bf ES:} Agree.}

The next choice we explore are the invariants \refneq{eq:invLaser} generated by
the moving frame method. The projections in \reffig{fig:CLEmf} reveal more about the
topology of the attractor but also present large ``jumps." Notice that
the invariants \refneq{eq:invLaser} are related to the invariant polynomials \refneq{eq:ipLaser}
by division by $\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}$ (except the one that is not present.) This is the
reason we get more clear dynamics: All invariants have the same
``dimensions" as the original coordinates. At the same time division by $\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}$
causes the jumps in the $\overline{y}$ components whenever the magnitude of $x$ comes close to zero.
Notice that we cannot have $x=0$ for dynamics away the $z$-axis due to the syzygy \refneq{eq:syzLaser}. For, if
$x=0$ then we would also have $y=0$ and thus we would cross the $z$-axis. This cannot happen
since the $z$ axis is the fixed point subspace of \SOn{2} and is therefore flow-invariant.

Geometrically we can interpret the jumps in the $\overline{y}$ coordinates as follows: We
have chosen to measure angle on one of the irreducible subspaces of \SOn{2}, the $x$-plane, and project
the dynamics on orbit space by counter-rotating in both irreducible subspaces (the $x$- and $y$-plane.)
As long a trajectory traces one lobe of the Lorenz attractor the angle varies slowly and no
problem occurs. When a trajectory changes quadrant in the $x$-plane to visit the almost opposite lobe (due to detuning
we don't visit the lobe related by rotation by $\pi$, in reality no such thing exists) we get a rapid
change in angle as the trajectory passes close to the origin. In the $y$-plane we don't necessarily change
quadrant. Call $\Delta \theta_x$ and $\Delta\theta_y$ the change in angle
in the $x$- and $y$-plane respectively, when the trajectory changes quadrant in the $x$ plane.
We always reduce to \reducedsp by correcting by $-\Delta\theta_x$ instead of correcting by the smallest angle\ES{I tried
implementing this directly. No luck.}.

Since $x$ cannot vanish the problem is mostly aesthetical in the present case,
but for \KSe\ it will be important to prevent
the denominator from vanishing. Since \SOn{2} acts irreducibly in the \CLe\ example
(and also in \KSe) we cannot take more than one irreducible subspace into account
when setting up the normalization equations. We can however restore democracy
between modes by modifying the invariants as follows:
    \PC{replaced ES version
\[\begin{split}
	\overline{x}_2 &= \frac{x_1^2+x_2^2}{\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+y_1^2+y_2^2}} \cont
	\overline{y}_1 &= -\frac{x_2 y_1-x_1 y_2}{\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+y_1^2+y_2^2}}\cont
	\overline{y}_2 &=\frac{x_1 y_1+x_2 y_2}{\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+y_1^2+y_2^2}}\cont
	\overline{z} &=z\,.
	\label{eq:invLaser2}
\end{split}
\]
    }
\beq
\begin{split}
	\overline{x}_2 &= (y_1^2+y_2^2)/r \cont
	\overline{y}_1 &= -(x_2 y_1-x_1 y_2)/r\cont
	\overline{y}_2 &=(x_1 y_1+x_2 y_2)/r\cont
	\overline{z} &=z\cont  
	r &= \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+y_1^2+y_2^2}
    \,.
	\label{eq:invLaser2}
\end{split}
\eeq
This set of invariants lacks a geometric interpretation\ES{or does it?} but results in much cleaner phase portraits,
\cf \reffig{fig:CLEinv}.
