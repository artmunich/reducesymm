I would first and foremost like to thank my advisor, Predrag Cvitanovi\'c,
for
\PublicPrivate{patient guidance}
	          {relentless indoctrination},
and dogged perfectionism.
In retrospect, I greatly appreciate Yueheng Lan's trailblazing
work\PublicPrivate{~.}{
, but the first thing I did when I took over his
graduate student desk was to throw away his complete collection of
article on \KS\  and related PDEs. For which I steel feel like a Nazi,
especially because I am reminded of it every once in a while,
but it is what Lan himself instruct me to do, giving me no indication
that those were useful papers. Which, useful papers, I suspect are now
on his desk in China.

I cheerfully wrote my first \KS\ code in 2004: How hard could
that be?

% People I have interacted with, learned from
Well, without Ruslan Davidchack, and the time he put into my
re-education I still would be wandering in wilderness.
I have
profited from John F.~Gibson's insights into \statesp\
visualization of high-dimensional fluid flows,
discussions with
Jonathan Halcrow's on desymmetrization of Lorenz and other
flows,
and
am grateful to Y.~Lan for pointing out to the
existence of the \EQV{1}~\eqv\ at the $L=22$ system size.
I thank
G.~Robinson,~Jr.\,, National Science Foundation grant
DMS-0807574 and a Gerondelis Foundation Scholarship
for partial financial support.
% PC: have you ever used PACE? Nope.
%Also a special thanks to the Georgia Tech Student Union
%who believed in us where NSF feared to thread,
%and generously funded our access
%to the Georgia Tech Public Access Cluster Environment (GT-PACE),
%essential to the
%computationally demanding \KS\ numerics.

Finally, I must acknowledge my parents without whose unwavering support
I would not be where I am today.
