I would first and foremost like to thank my advisor, Predrag Cvitanovi\'c,
for
\PublicPrivate{relentless guidance}
	          {relentless indoctrination},
and dogged perfectionism.

I cheerfully wrote my first \KS\ code in 2004:
How hard could that be?
Well, without Ruslan Davidchack,
 and the time he put into my re-education
I still would be wandering in wilderness.
I greatly appreciate
Yueheng Lans's trailblazing.

I thank
G.~Robinson,~Jr. and National Science Foundation for financial support.

Also a special thanks to the Georgia Tech Student Union
who believed in us where NSF feared to thread,
and generously funded our access
to the Georgia Tech Public Access Cluster Environment (GT-PACE),
essential to the
computationally demanding \KS\ computations
without which there would have been no thesis to write.

Finally, I must acknowledge my parents without whose unwavering support
I would not be where I am today.
