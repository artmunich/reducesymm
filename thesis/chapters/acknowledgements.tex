I would first and foremost like to thank my advisor, Predrag Cvitanovi\'c,
for
\PublicPrivate{patient guidance}
	          {relentless indoctrination},
and dogged perfectionism.
In retrospect, I greatly appreciate Yueheng Lan's trailblazing
work%
\PublicPrivate{.~}
              {, but the first thing I did when I took over his
graduate student desk was to throw away his complete collection of
article on \KS\  and related PDEs.
              }
I cheerfully wrote my first \KS\ code in 2004:
How hard could that be?
Well, without Ruslan Davidchack,
 and the time he put into my re-education
I still would be wandering in wilderness.

I thank
G.~Robinson,~Jr. and National Science Foundation
grant DMS-0807574
for partial financial support.

Also a special thanks to the Georgia Tech Student Union
who believed in us where NSF feared to thread,
and generously funded our access
to the Georgia Tech Public Access Cluster Environment (GT-PACE),
essential to the
computationally demanding \KS\ computations
without which there would have been no thesis to write.

Finally, I must acknowledge my parents without whose unwavering support
I would not be where I am today.
