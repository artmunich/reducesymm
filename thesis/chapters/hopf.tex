This thesis is part of a wider effort \ES{Add reference to all KS, plane Couette
and any other relevant paper} to describe turbulence from
a dynamical systems perspective that goes back to the seminal paper of
Hopf\rf{hopf48}. The relation of dynamics to turbulence underlies many 
fundamental developements in dynamical systems theory, 
from the very (re)discovery of chaos by Lorenz\rf{lorenz} to the
Ruelle-Takens\rf{ruell71} view of turbulence, to the more recent work on inertial
manifolds\rf{constantin_integral_1989} of partial differential equations (PDEs).
The emphasis here is not on the transition to turbulence or on the derivation
of reduced models of a partial differential equation. On the contrary we ask:
For a given system (and boundary conditions) which we have the ability
to numerically simulate to sufficient (but always finite) accuracy to resolve
its finest features, how do we develop a dynamical description?

Hopf's answer\rf{hopf48}\ES{Is this reference accurate? In Christiansen et al an
anecdotical reference is given.} is to consider the dynamics of a PDE not as the evolution
of snapshots of the underlying field but as dynamics on an $\infty$-dimensional
phase space in which every point corresponds to a state of the system. Then
a generic turbulent trajectory visits a ``regular'' solution for a while, then
switches to another one and so on.
For any given system, parameter values and boundary conditions there are two
ingredients to implementing this vision: (a) the geometry of the \statesp\ and 
(b) the associated natural measure, \ie, the likelihood that asymptotic dynamics 
visits a given \statesp\ region.

The first succesful quantitative implementation of Hopf's vision for a spatialy
extended system, to the best of the authors knowledge, can be found in Christiansen~\etal\rf{Christiansen97}. They study \KS\ equation, a dissipative PDE in one spatial dimension as one of the simplest systems that exhibits features reminiscent of fluid turbulence, \cf \refchap{chap:KSe} for details. The ``regular'' solutions in Hopf's picture were realized
as the set of all periodic orbits, embedded into the attractor and ordered hierarhicaly. Shorter
orbits provided the basic building elements of the attractor, while longer ones contributed
corrections. The quantitative framework within which those periodic orbits were used to
approximate the natural measure and calculate ``observable'' quantities, such as Lyapunov exponents and escape rates, was that of periodic orbit theory\rf{dasbuch}, \cf \refchap{chap:POT}. The same approach has been carried out in a ``more turbulent'' \KS\ system in \ref{LanThesis,CviLan}. 

Recently, phase space of moderate Reynolds number wall bounded shear flows became experimentally\rf{science04} and computationally\rf{KawKida01}\ES{get refs to all Halcrow, Gibson et al papers, Viswanath.} accessible. The charting of Navier-Stokes phase space, for specific boundary conditions, with equilibria, traveling waves and heteroclinic connections has provided the basic
elements of the geometry of the turbulent flow and there is hope that it will eventualy lead
to approximation of the natural measure using a set of ``regular'' solutions.


% We prepare for two future generalizations: invariant tori - ``larger'' symmetries.
