Relative periodic orbits of Kuramoto-Sivanshisky Equation

The Kuramoto-Sivasinsky partial differential equation (KSe) is studied as a prototypical system that exhibits spatiotemporal chaos. In our approach the system in a periodic domain is treated as a dynamical system of a large but finite number of degrees of freedom. Adopting this view our purpose is to apply periodic orbit theory in KSe. 
We are interested in the asymptotic (large time) behaviour of the system. In the context of periodic orbit theory the invariant objects (equilibria and periodic orbits) of the system are used to extract
