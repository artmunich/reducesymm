When statistical assumptions do not hold and coherent
structures are present in extended systems
such as fluid flows, flame fronts and field theories
a dynamical description of turbulent phenomena becomes
necessary. Such a description relies on understanding of
the geometry of dynamical state space 
in terms of unstable recurrent solutions, around which evolution
is organized. 

In translationaly invariant systems traveling solutions become
as important as stationary solutions and recurrence becomes relative.
