The KS work
% described in \refsect{s:KS}
of \refref{Christiansen:97}
was restricted to the antisymmetric subspace.
The restriction to antisymmetric subspace was used
to eliminate the continous translational symmetry of \KSe.
Due to the lack of self-adjointness
(non-normality) of the linearized \KS\ flow, 
the antisymmetric subspace
is unstable under small perturbations, and generic solutions of 
KS belong to the full, periodic space.
Nevertheless, 
the \eqva\ and the shortest \po s orbits that lie in this subspace
and play important role for global topology of the flow,
together
with the \reqva\ and \rpo s
characteristic of the full, continuous translation invariant space..
The key new feature of the full, periodic domain
KS is its continous translational symmetry,
with attendandt continuous families of
\reqva\ (travelling waves) and \rpo s.
\Rpo s, in particular, require rethinking dynamical systems
approach to constructing symbolic dynamics.

An instructive 
example is offered by the dynamics for $\tilde{L}=3.5014$, % (L=22).
currently studied in collaboration with
R.L. Davidchack (U. Leicester, UK).
For this small periodic cell
the chaotic dynamics arises from
a competition between unstable
wavelength 2- and 3- coherent structures.
We refer to wavelength 1-, 2- and 3- unstable \eqva\ as
\nameit{1},\nameit{2} and \nameit{3},
respectively.
In \reffig{f:KS22unstM} (a)
color indicates the value of $u(x,t)$ in 
the $(x,t)$ space-time plane.
Spatial representations of
PDEs (such as the 3$d$
snapshots of velocity and vorticity fields in Navier-Stokes)
offer little insight into detailed dynamics of low-$Re$ flows.
Much more illuminating are the phase space representations.
In \refFig{f:KS22unstM} (b) the \eqv\ \nameit{1} of
\reffig{f:KS22unstM} (a) is represented by the point \nameit{1},
and its unstable manifold can be examined in great detail.
To each \eqv\ point corresponds a continous family
of \eqva, and this leads to an unexpected feature of such
flows: While in dimensions higher than 2 heteroclinic connections 
are a rarity (likelihood that unstable manifold of one
 \eqv\ precisely hits another \eqv\ point is zero), 
for flows with continuous symmetries intersections of unstable
manifolds with continuous families of equvalent \eqva\ are common.
\refFig{f:KS22unstM} (b) and (c) show 
such heteroclinic connections.
% from an \nameit{2}~\eqv\ point to \nameit{3}~\eqv\ family.
These connections partition the phase space,
and will be the basis of our
{\bf construction of symbolic dynamics}.
Effective symbolic dynamics allows
for a systematic and exhaustive determination 
of all \rpo s, in the spirit of 
the earlier work presented in \refsect{s:KS}.
Many short unstable \rpo s have been already 
been computed using trial trajectories based on above
topological connections as starting  guesses 
for variants of the Newton method.
% They typically have either one unstable eigenvalue, or one complex
% eigenvalue pair.

KS symbolic dynamics will
serve as a testbed for developing the
same for PCF, and for applications of the new
trace formula with continous symmetries (\refsect{s:relativePOT}).
