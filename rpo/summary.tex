\Preliminary{ unstable coherent structures vs. models of turbulence}

At first glance, turbulant dynamics visualized in the state space might appear
hopelessly complex, but under a detailed examination it appears 
much less so than feared: it is
pieced together from essentially {1-$d$ return maps}
connected by fast transient interludes.
{\KS} and \PCf\  equilibrium, travelling and 
periodic solutions embody Hopf's vision:
repertoire of recurrent spatio-temporal
patterns explored by turbulent dynamics.
