\section{Small \KS\ $L=22$ system {\rpo s}}

% Davidchack and Crofts
The full space \KS system $L = 22.0$ 
appears to be the smallest $L$ with persistent chaos.  
$L=22$ is a sensible choice because in units of mean wavelength
the size of this small system is about $ \tilde{L}/\sqrt{2}= 2.4758$
2.5 wavelengths, 
so the dynamics is competition between wavenumbers
2 and 3.
Because of the strong contractionin KS we expect at most 10 eigenvalues to be
significant, rest are in the numerical noise. See figure~6 in
\refref{Christiansen:97}.

% Davidchack and Crofts 
We investigate this system in 15 complex Fourier modes
(30-dimensional system of real ODEs) truncation, and recheck the results 
by redoing the calculation with the double number of Fourier modes.
% observe how many digits change. 
The \eqv\ points are accurate to at least to $10^{-11}$. Since
Lapack is also double precision accurate, the accuracy of the first
few eigenvalues is similar, and certainly in
excess of 6 significant digits.
%
All digits stated in tables are significant.

The accuracy that can be reached is of order of
$|a(\period{p},d_p) - a_0| \approx \epsilon \exp(\Lyap_p \period{p})$,
where $\epsilon \approx 10^{-17}$ for double precision,
$\lambda_p$ is the largest Lyapunov exponent, 
and $\period{p}$ the period.  With a good starting guess,
Newton's method
typically reaches that accuracy after 2-3 iterates.


\Eqva\ and \reqva\ of \KSe\ are investigated in Kevrekidis \etal\rf{saddks}. 
Many of the \rpo s can be constructed from segments corresponding to
close approches to some of these equlibria.

\subsection{\Eqva}

Numerically we find \eqva\ of wavenumber $k$ by (when it exists)
by using $sin( k x /\tilde{L})$ as the initial guess for the Newton routine.
The \eqva\ {\nameit}2 and {\nameit}3 found here
essentially lie in the 2nd and 3rd Fourier component complex planes,
respectively, with very
small deformations from higher harmonics.
\RLD{recheck their $a_1$ content}

For $L = 22.0$ there are at least
3 unstable \eqva\ and a pair of unstable \reqva:

\PC{probably make up a table with all these}
Wavenumber 0 \eqv\ {\nameit}0, $u=0$, with multipliers 
(eigenvalues of $\Mvar$):

\PC{these we have analytically, all real.
Enter values here, refer to the equation}

\PC{why is there no wavenumber 1 \eqv\ {\nameit}1?}

Wavenumber 2 \eqv\ {\nameit}2, with multipliers 
\ES{I observe pairs of real eigenvalues,
e.g. -58.3602685 and -58.3602681. As their absolute
value increases they differ even less.
I think it has to do with the linear part being the main
contribution to $\Mvar$ for higher modes, as well as 
with treating real and imaginary components 
as separate variables, which means it will appear twice.
	}
\PC{I think such contracting eigenvalues as -58.3602685 have no meaning.
Even if they are accurate eigenvalues of $\Mvar$,
what use is
$\ExpaEig_{radial} =  e^{\Lyap_p \period{p}} = e^{26\cdot58} = e^{1510}$.
	}

$(\Lyap_i \pm \theta_i)
=(
  0.13903973 \pm i 0.23842023,
  0,
 -0.08402656 \pm i 0.16019413,
 -0.11941393, 
 -0.27112264 \pm i 0.35630716,
 -2.01303043,
 -2.03775342,
 -5.63649418,
\cdots
)$
\PC{need to decide: eigs either appear as complex pairs, or
real pairs, because of complex Fourier coefficients. Should we list
real pairs? Probably best to list them only once.}

Wavenumber 3 \eqv\ {\nameit}3, with multipliers 
\RLD{fill in the values}

$(\Lyap_i \pm \theta_i)
=(
  0.?,
  0,
 -0.? \pm i 0.?,
 -0.?, 
 -0.? \pm i 0.?,
\cdots
)$


These \eqva\ are selfdual under $u(x) \to -u(-x)$ symmetry.

\underline{Need to trace out}
the unstable manifold plane, like Gibson did for plane Couette.
Compute the 2 expanding eigenvectors of the
\eqv\ {\nameit}2, as well as the 3rd, least contracting direction; then
translate and rotate your Fourier modes into this coordinate frame,
and plot the trajectory there, both in the lab and the mean velocity frame.


\subsection{\Reqva}

There is a pair of \Reqva\ 
${\nameit}1L$,
${\nameit}1R$
(traveling waves), dual under the
$u(x) \to -u(-x)$ symmetry. They are 
determined numerically by 
adiabatic continuation from a smaller system size
$L~\approx 12$,
where they are stable, to $L=22$
where their velocity is atypically large, $v=7.?$,
\RLD{fill in the values}
and
their multipliers are:
\RLD{fill in the values}

$(\Lyap_i \pm \theta_i)
=(
  0.?,
  0,
 -0.? \pm i 0.?,
 -0.?, 
 -0.? \pm i 0.?,
\cdots
)$

\PC{why is there are no wavenumber 2 \reqva\ {\nameit}2L, {\nameit}2R?}

The pair of \Reqva\ 
${\nameit}3L$,
${\nameit}3R$
exists for larger system sizes, but does not continue 
adiabatically\rf{saddks} down to $L=22$.

The \reqva s (or travelling waves) appear to have a limiting propagation
velocity $d/\period{}$. 
To visualize them numerically,
start with a localized self-dual $u(x,0)$ such as
\[
u(x,0) = x e^{- x^2/2\sigma^2}
\,,
\]
with typical width $\sigma/2$ of order of typical wavelngth 
$\sqrt{2}$ (in $\tilde{L}$ system size units).
Time evolution of this  $u(x,t)$ is bracketed by two constant 
pulses of apparently constant velocity $v=?$.
\RLD{generate figure, state $\sigma/2$, estimate $v$}
The notion of ``velocity''
is fuzzed up by the fact that the large peaks are preceeded
by smaller precursors.

\PC{Determine their velocity ANALYTICALLY?}
\PC{comment on exact soliton solutions, Lan's thesis.}

\subsection{\Rpo s}

\ES{
The names of the \rpo\ figure files follow the convention
 {\tt rpoL-T-d.eps}s, with suffixes {\tt cm}
and {\tt u} indicating
 mean velocity frame  and $u$ representation respectively.
   }
%
Out of 30 \rpo s they
find,  only three are truly periodic.  The orbit
with $\period{p} = 95.25$ has a very small
$d = -6.5\,e^{-7}$, but it is not periodic 
(they
checked this by decreasing the integration step size and increasing the
number of modes).

The dynamics in this small system is competition between wavenumbers
2 and 3. The 2-equilibrium and the (2?) 3-equilibria essentially lie in
the 2nd and 3rd Fourier component complex plane, with very
small deformations from higher harmonics.
Hence plot all \rpo s in these 2 representations:

$[ \Re a_2, \Im a_2, \Re a_3 ]$
(here 2-equilibrium is a circle, 3-equilibrium (-ia?) a vertical line)
 and
$[ \Re a_3, \Im a_3, \Re a_2 ]$
(here 3-equilibrium is a circle, 2-equilibrium a vertical line)

It is very instructive, and seems to suggest that some as yet
undetermined travelling waves control most trajectories part way.

The \rpo\ {\nameit}55 travels between the equilibrium A and a
travelling wave B (?) 
with period and shift
$\period{p}=55.5953 d=5.24725$
Compared to $L/4 = 5.5$
this is nice, but why not close to periodic after 2nd return? Why 4th return?

\Rpo\ {\nameit}55 looks similar to Davidchack's  orbit
of period 
$\period{p}=47.64$ and $d=5.6759$. The period appears to depend on how
many times the orbit manages to spiral around the equilibria.
For {\nameit}55 that appears to be
1.5 times per period, rather than 2. This would led as
to
think there is a family of \rpo s along with a 3rd unit eigenvalue of
$gJ$,
but such does not exist.
So there has to be a selection mechanism corresponding to
reaching or missing the neighborhood of an equilibrium point starting from
the neighborhood of the other. 

This stuff is hard to visualize... for ordinary periodic orbits one
plots the unstable plane of the equilibrium, shows where the periodic
orbits sit. Other options:

Somewhat better visualization is in the
{\em mean velocity frame}, {\ie} 
a reference frame that rotates with with velocity 
$v_p=d_p/\period{p}$
In the mean velocity frame a \rpo\ becomes
a \po.
Co-moving frmae visualization helps quite a bit. Put a black (green, respectively) dot
twice thicknes of the line every time unit; it will enable you to see
where the motion is slow and where it is fast
% (a trick we used to understand plane Couette trajectories).
Mark the inital point on both
mean velocity \rpo\ and on equilibrium in mean velocity
 frame with a fat triangle
indicating the direction, so we can see how they both move. Probably at the
opposite ends of the two curves - mean velocity frame is the mean motion.

%   rpo/figs/detail1rpo22-55-4.eps
%   rpo/figs/detail2rpo22-55-4.eps
%   rpo/figs/detail3rpo22-55-4.eps
%   break rpo22-55-4 into 3 parts.
%   The script for the fonts somehow crops these images

Each {\rpo} has its own mean velocity frame - and within it, equilibria
move on circles (or worse - because in higher Fourier modes they do mmore
complicted things), and it is important to know where the equlibrium is at
a given instant.

The $u$ space time evolution \reffig{f:rpo55u} % rpo22-55-4-u.eps 
is plotted with the same starting instant,
so one can also track also the spatial profile $u$ in parallel with
the Fourier space projections.

So it is almost impossible to see \reffig{f:rpo55}(b) %rpo22-55-4-cm.eps
in \reffig{f:rpo55}(a) % rpo22-55-4.eps.
I can see 4 periods in \reffig{f:rpo55}(a), %po22-55-4.eps,
but not in \reffig{f:rpo55}(b) %rpo22-55-4-cm.eps
where it comes back only after full period $\period{p}=55.6$.

It still seems that it could be made relative periodic 
(modulo a reflection symmetry?)
in $\period{p}/4=55.6/4=13.9$? That would be OK 
-
by symmetry the figure 8 connecting
2 symmetric equilibria could consist of 4 identical segments: from
equilibrium A to midplane, then reflected version of the same to SA, and
back again.

\Eqv\ are solutions of 3-$d$ set of ODEs  \refeq{eq:3dks}, so
another convenient way to plot \eqva\ and \reqva\ on a periodic
domain $L$ is to plot 
$\partial u(x)$ vs. $u(x)$ as a curve parametized by
$x\in [0,L]$. In this representation both \eqva\ and \reqva\ curves are
stationary, but the points on \reqva\ move as functions of time.

\Po s and \Rpo s can be plotted this way as well
$\partial u(x,t)$ vs. $u(x,t)$. Now they are are represented by time-dependent
``tube".

The two equilibria
capture qualitatively the mean velocity frame \rpo\ {\nameit}55 shape,
which follows the
equilibrium for most of the time, except for a quick swing where it
sidesteps by $d/4$, just as it does in \reffig{f:rpo55}. 

Please also plot it in plane, chose small Fourier coefficients
 which respect the $x \to -x$ symmetry of \KSe.
Then the symmetry of 2 mean velocity
equilibria and self-dual symmetry of \rpo\ {\nameit}55 will be explicit.

Eigenvalues of \rpo\ {\nameit}55 $g\jMps$: are
\\
$(-57.17,  1.00009, 1.00001, -0.500, -0.012, \cdots)$ .
%
%  Eigenvalues of the Jacobian without rotation
%  84.15, -33.86 + 28.94 i, c.c. , 0.48, 0.00019
% no good - missing marginal ones

There are two
marginal eigenvalues, one for time translation, one for
rotational invariance. 
The sign of $\ExpaEig_{1}=-57$ says this is a Moebius-kind orbit,
inverse hyperbolic.
Lyapunov $\Lyap=0.07$ says that this neighborhood is much less repelling than
the central equilibrium A, a better candidate for being embedded into the
ergodic attractor.

The \rpo\ initial condition is
so accurate the orbit in \reffig{f:rpo55}(b)
start visibly deviating after retracing the loop 6.5 times.
% the largest unstable multiplier is 
% $-57.17$ per period of the orbit - error would grow to $\approx 60^7
% = 2,800,000,000,000$.

For the \rpo s the accuracy of Jacobian depends
on the time step size, and long runs are needed to refine the results

For a numerical check of the \rpo\ stability eigenvalues,
used two inital
points along an unstable eigenvector $\jEigvec{1}$
at radial distance  $\approx 10^{-4}$ from the \eqv\ {\nameit}2,
and the initial inter-point separation $\Delta(0) \approx 10^{-5}$.
Integrated for time equal to the period $\period{p}=26.3556$ as calculated from
the \jacobianM\ and computed the leading Lyapunov exponent from the ratio of
final to initial distance 
$\Lyap= {1 \over \period{}}\ln( \Delta(\period{})/\Delta(0))$.
Get
$\Delta(\period{})/\Delta(0) =39.01$,
$\Lyap=0.13902$, in agreement with the \eqv\ {\nameit}2 
expanding eigenvalue $\Lyap=0.13904$
\[
\ExpaEig_{radial} =  e^{\Lyap \period{}} =38.99
\,.
\]
