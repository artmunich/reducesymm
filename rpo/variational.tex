    In order to set the notation, we shall distinguish between (see \reffig{f:loops}):

\medskip
\noindent
 {\bf closed path:}
 any closed (not necessarily differentiable) continuous curve 
$J \subset \pS$.

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf loop:}
 a smooth, differentiable closed curve $\lSpace(s)\in \Loop \subset 
\pS$, 
parametrized by $s \in [0,2\pi]$ with $\lSpace(s)=\lSpace(s+2\pi)$, with the
magnitude of the loop tangent vector fixed by 
the (so far arbitrary) parametrization of the loop,
\[
\lVeloc(\lSpace)=\frac{d \lSpace}{ds}\,, \quad \lSpace=\lSpace(s) \in \Loop
\,.
\]   
{\bf annulus:} 
 a smooth, differentiable surface $\lSpace(s,\tau)\in \Loop(\tau)$ swept by a 
family of loops $\Loop(\tau)$, by integration along a fictitious time flow
(see \reffig{f:velocField}~(a))
\[
\dot{\lSpace}=\frac{\partial \lSpace}{\partial \tau}
\,.
\]
{\bf periodic orbit:}
 given a smooth vector field $\pVeloc=\pVeloc(\pSpace),\; (\pSpace,\pVeloc) \in {\bf T} \pS$, periodic orbit $\pSpace(t) \in p$ is a solution of
\[
\frac{dx}{dt}=\pVeloc(\pSpace) 
	\,,\quad
	\mbox{ such that } \pSpace(t)=\pSpace(t+\period{p}),
\] 
where $\period{p}$ is the shortest period of $p$.



The strategy
is to minimize an action functional defined on a space of paths $\gamma$ in the
configuration space $\pS$ which satisfy the property
\beq
                               \gamma (t + T ) = g \cdot \gamma (t)                       
\label{McC1desc}
\eeq
for a fixed {\em relative period} $T$ and some fixed diffeomorphism $g$ of $\pS$, 
sometimes referred to as a {\em phase}, that leaves the 
action functional invariant. If $g^k=1$ is of finite order
$k$, then the corresponding orbit is periodic with period $k T$.
