The \KS\ system\rf{ku,siv},
arising in the description of the flame front flutter of  gas burning in
a cylindrically symmetric burner on your kitchen stove,
and many other problems of greater import,
is one of the simplest partial differential equations that
exhibit turbulence.
The time evolution of the ``height of the flame front'' 
is given by
\beq
u_t=(u^2)_x-u_{xx}- u_{xxxx}
\,,\qquad	x \in [0,L]
\,.
\ee{ks}
In this equation $t \geq 0$ is the time and
$x$ is the spatial coordinate.
The subscripts $x$ and $t$ denote partial derivatives with respect to
$x$ and $t$;
$u_t = du/dt$, $u_{xxxx}$ stands for the 4th spatial
derivative of 
$u=u(x,t)$ at position $x$ and time $t$.
% The ``viscosity'' parameter 
% $\nu$ controls the 
% suppression of solutions with fast spatial variations.
% We take note, as in the Navier-Stokes equation, of the
% $u {\partial_x} u$ ``inertial'' term, the $ {\partial_x^2 } u$
% ``diffusive'' term (both with a ``wrong'' sign), etc.

% The term $(u^2)_x$ makes this a {\em nonlinear system}.
% It is one of the
% simplest conceivable nonlinear PDE, playing
% the role in the theory of spatially extended systems
% analogous to the role that
% the $x^2$ nonlinearity
% % \refeq{LogisMap}
% plays in the dynamics of iterated mappings.

% The salient feature of such
% partial differential equations is a theorem saying that
% for any finite value of the phase-space contraction
% parameter $\nu$,  the asymptotic dynamics is
% describable by a {\em finite} set of ``inertial manifold''
% ordinary differential equations. %cite{Foias88}.


In order to find a better representation of the dynamics, we now
turn to its topological invariants.
