    abstract = "The continuous and discrete symmetries of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system 
		restricted to a spatially periodic domain play a prominent role in shaping 
		the invariant sets of its chaotic dynamics. The continuous spatial translation 
		symmetry leads to relative equilibrium (traveling wave) and relative periodic 
		orbit (modulated traveling wave) solutions. The discrete symmetries lead 
		to existence of equilibrium and periodic orbit solutions, induce decomposition 
		of state space into invariant subspaces, and enforce certain structurally stable 
		heteroclinic connections between equilibria. We show, on the example of a 
		particular small-cell Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system, how the geometry of its 
		dynamical state space is organized by a rigid `cage' built by heteroclinic 
		connections between equilibria, and demonstrate the preponderance of unstable 
		relative periodic orbits and their likely role as the skeleton underpinning 
		spatiotemporal turbulence in systems with continuous symmetries. We also offer 
		novel visualizations of the high-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky state space 
		flow through projections onto low-dimensional, PDE representation independent, 
		dynamically invariant intrinsic coordinate frames, as well as in terms of the physical, 
		symmetry invariant energy transfer rates. ",

    abstract = "We present two continuous symmetry reduction methods for reducing high-dimensional 
		dissipative flows to local return maps. In the Hilbert polynomial basis approach, 
		the equivariant dynamics is rewritten in terms of invariant coordinates. In the 
		method of moving frames (or method of slices) the state space is sliced locally 
		in such a way that each group orbit of symmetry-equivalent points is represented 
		by a single point. In either approach, numerical computations can be performed 
		in the original state-space representation, and the solutions are then projected 
		onto the symmetry-reduced state space. The two methods are illustrated by reduction 
		of the complex Lorenz system, a 5-dimensional dissipative flow with rotational symmetry. 
		While the Hilbert polynomial basis approach appears unfeasible for high-dimensional flows,
		symmetry reduction by the method of moving frames offers hope.",

  abstract = "When statistical assumptions do not hold and coherent structures are 
	      present in spatially extended systems such as fluid flows, flame fronts 
	      and field theories, a dynamical description of turbulent phenomena becomes necessary. 
	      In the dynamical systems approach, theory of turbulence for a given system, with 
	      given boundary conditions, is given by (a) the geometry of its infinite-dimensional 
	      state space and (b) the associated measure, that is, the likelihood that asymptotic 
	      dynamics visits a given state space region.     
	      In this thesis this vision is pursued in the context of Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system, 
	      one of the simplest physically interesting spatially extended nonlinear systems. 
	      With periodic boundary 
	      conditions, continuous translational symmetry endows state space with additional 
	      structure that often dictates the type of observed solutions. At the same time, 
	      the notion of recurrence becomes relative: asymptotic dynamics visits the neighborhood 
	      of any equivalent, translated point, infinitely often. Identification of points related 
	      by the symmetry group action, termed symmetry reduction, although conceptually 
	      simple as the group action is linear, is hard to implement in practice, 
	      yet it leads to dramatic simplification of dynamics. 
	      Here we propose a scheme, based on the method of moving frames of Cartan, 
	      to efficiently project solutions of high-dimensional truncations of partial 
	      differential equations computed in the original space to a reduced state space. 
	      The procedure simplifies the visualization of high-dimensional flows and provides 
	      new insight into the role the unstable manifolds of equilibria and traveling waves 
	      play in organizing Kuramoto-Sivashinsky flow. This in turn elucidates the mechanism 
	      that creates unstable modulated traveling waves (periodic orbits in reduced space) 
	      that provide a skeleton of the dynamics. The compact description of dynamics thus 
	      achieved sets the stage for reduction of the dynamics to mappings between a set of 
	      Poincare sections.",
