\item[2011-05-27 Predrag, weather report from Snowbird DS11]
	\toCB
Learned from Pierrehumbert that the baroclinic models are to weathermen
what ``harmonic oscillator'' is to quantum mechanics. It has a continuous
East-West translational symmetry, \ie, in a periodic box it needs to be
sliced (the \SOn{2} of periodic box quotiented out).

Tried to proselytize Christian Wolfe\rf{WoSa07}, Scripts,  make him slice
the baroclinic instability, and, perchance, if I get him there, recycle
it, former Gibson style. Pierrehumbert says that this would be persuasive
to weather people, convince them to go looking for exact unstable
invariant solutions. After one hour Wolfe said he was converted.

Tried ditto with Pierrehumbert and Silber postdoc Yi-Ping Ma (Knobloch
trained, has worked with Spiegel at Woods Hole GFD). He does not know any
geophysical fluid dynamics yet, so I'm sceptical that he will do anything.

\item[2011-05-27 Annalisa Bracco]
If you ever need a code that produce baroclinic instability, I have
plenty. Worked with the Baroclinic Instability Man as a postdoc. I also
have an easy atmospheric model (global, on a sphere etc) that reproduces
very well baroclinic instability as per observations and can be run as
aqua-planet to simplify things.

\item[2011-05-27 Predrag]
Joe Pedlosky? We plumbers could make Joe happy? Let's do it before
August, in time for Woods Hole. The first step is to slice your
simulations for a minimal periodic cell of interest (narrow but
turbulent). The second step might be either to determine ``physical
dimension'' using Wolfe-Samelson\rf{WoSa07} Lyapunov vectors (that is
just simulation) or find some traveling waves (that is Krylov-Arnoldi
nontrivial work, but for low-dimensional discretizations might be doable
by Newton).

'Baroclinic' means that the instability is driven by density difference;
'barotropic' means not. Annalisa has shown Predrag some simulations.
Baroclinic instability is modeled by a 2-layer incompressible viscous
fluid in a channel with no-slip side walls, periodic in streamwise
direction, top layer driven by `atmospheric stream', \ie\ a constant
total streamwise volume flow per unit time. She simply imposes uniform
streamwise velocity of unit size, ignoring the boundary condition (could
use a parabolic profile). With free slip the layers are still unstable in
the same way, just the boundary behavior is different. Oceanographers
prefer no-slip, perhaps because of coastal stream. The bottom layer is
not forced, no slip, no Eckman layer (Eckman layer models friction at the
bottom; that would make sense when she works with 50 layers, but not
two). The two layers are coupled by the difference $\Phi_2 - \Phi_1$.
Laplacian of stream function is vorticity. Each layer is computed in
terms of vorticity equations as a 2-dimensional fluid. The lower layer
has higher fluid density, and they are coupled across their interface by
difference of vorticity. This is about factor two; it is related to the
R\"osby deformation radius $L_R$. The spanwise $y$ width is $L_R/2\pi =
1/2$. Unless the width is larger than $L_R$, no instability. The
stream-wise aspect ration is about 8.

They tend to the barotropic solution (vortices rotating the same way on
top and bottom).


Discussion of solutions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item [1)]
is linear: dropped the nonlinear term \ie\ the Jacobian of the vorticity
and the stream function. Instability is seeded by a small random field of
prescribed power spectrum, but the resulting instability is a localized
wave (about 3 rolls) with streamwise/spanwise ratio of about 1/2 set
$L_R$. That sets the scale of the instability off the laminar solution.
Initial noise does not matter, as the instability grows very fast. The
two layer vorticities are opposite.

  \item [2)] is fully nonlinear, all other parameters the same.

  \item [3)]
\end{enumerate}

\item[2011-10-18 Annalisa]

\refFig{2layerBclin}\,(a)
The usual domain $L=8$, 2 layers. Note that as
for initial conditions, the overall the flow is more energetic.

\refFig{2layerBclin}\,(b)
The reduced domain $L=4$, 2 layers. Correct initial conditions, starting
from a linear solution. The energy is not yet fully equilibrated. One
problem I can see is that the periodic boundary conditions may prevent
perfect equilibration. Anyway, it'll be running over night. The longer
cell \refFig{2layerBclin}\,(a) behaves pretty much the same way, but
overall the circulation is a bit stronger.

\item[2011-10-19 Annalisa]
There is a barotropization issue, likely due to the periodic boundaries.
My guess is that we'll not need a very long simulation and we can live
with a non perfectly stationary state (essentially the eddies that form
in the equilibrated solution prefer to be barotropic -same sign top and
bottom layer- because they are more stable and in the absence of
viscosity, \etc\ they are an exact solution of \NS), and the simulation goes
into a state that resembles the long-term state for 2-d turbulence. If we
could work only over times $\sim $40-70 we should be all set.

For now the time is just in code units, I'll convert it in something
meaningful once we decide on which run to use, \etc.

\item[2011-10-20 Predrag]
Bit worried if we are in transient turbulence, on the way to a
barotropic state, but might work out... (will include 111018time50,
111018time70 and 111018time100 later...)

\item[2011-10-20 Annalisa]
One way to reduce the problem may be to stick to the 'longer' domain.
Another is to introduce a sponge region on one side. It'll not solve it
completely (eddies are just more stable if barotropic and they tend to
become so while equilibrating a baroclinic solution), but it may delay
it.

\item[2011-10-20 Predrag]
It's OK that whole thing decays to barotropic, as long as we can find
unstable equilibrium solutions. Next (big) step. The short step is
to start looking at the dynamics of a short domain in the state space,
as explained in ChaosBook.org/tutorials, click on 'state space' in the
menu on the left.

\item[2011-10-20 Annalisa]
I may be able to stabilize it in a weakly nonlinear regime without
vortices but still something going on. I checked Wolfe PhD thesis and
it's all done in a very weakly nonlinear regime, so waves (just not
perfectly regular).

\item[2011-10-20 Edward A. Spiegel] {\em Baroclinic tutorial?}
	
Baroclinic instability is a buoyancy driven instability in which horizontal
gradients and rotation play complicating parts.   Basically, because of
effect of rotation, the displacement of a fluid parcel that unleashes
the instability is not vertical as in R-B convection.  Or, if you prefer,
in the presence of rotation, your notion of what is vertical is changed.

Anyway, the Man is Pedlosky and he has given (and written) GFD lectures
that do a pretty good job of explaining the stuff.  If you are face to face
with the right person, such as Joe, it is no problem, but over Skype it
could be no fun.  I think you should read a bit first and then talk to a
person.
Anyway, it is time for you to test the waters of GFD books.  For agreeable
starts try

Rick Salmon's "Lectures on Geophysical Fluid Dynamics " or

James Holton's "An Intro. to Dynamic Meteorology."

Then talk to someone.

I once supervised a summer GFD project on baroclinic instability
and I think it made a nice self-contained package, so I attach it.
You may not want to start with that heavy a story.  I have some
easier stuff but I have no idea where you put it so I can say only
that you should look for the term "Eady problem."  Or call if you
feel like it.

\item[2011-10-20 Predrag 2 EAS]
funny thing is I was reading
\HREF{http://www.whoi.edu/fileserver.do?id=21275&pt=10&p=17233}
{A. E. Hasha} (2005) report \emph{A Search for Baroclinic Structures}
when your email arrived. Nice report. I can be more specific:

When I look at Annalisa's 2-layer simulations (driven at top by
a constant velocity field, streamwise length = 8 channel widths,
Rossby number = 2) it looks to me that baroclinic vortices get
converted onto barotropic ones, and there is nothing that would
sustain generation of new baroclinic vortices (opposite vorticity
in the two layers), so there is no sustained turbulence, it looks only
transient. Or am I missing something?

See, talking might be more efficient. I had scheduled a date with
the Man Pedlosky, but Lady Pedlosky had to get chemo, so that never
happened...

\item[2011-10-21 EAS]
This sounds like a case for cyclic behavior.  That is, when the
barotropic vortices decay, you go back to the baroclinically unstable
situation and it all starts over.   Why it might do this instead of
staying in a mildly unstable, statistically steady case all the time
is a bit of a mystery.  (Are you sure that it does not?)   There are
other examples where systems go cyclic in this way instead of
maintaining a quasi-steady mean state but I have not found the
clue to predicting which case one will get.  For example, why do
things go all barotropic in your case?

Anyway, if you keep running Annalisa's case, I presume the
barotropic vortices will run down and the baroclinic instability
will come back.

\item[2011-10-21 Annalisa]
OK, but it'll take a LONG time, because the dissipation time of
relatively large, single eddies is pretty small (plus is one of those
situations where the model domain play such a role that the 'real'
application is close to null

\item[2011-10-22 Predrag 2 Annalisa] I'm working on writing up
the physical ways of projecting turbulent flows onto handful of
\statesp\ coordinates. The derivation of the first set,
$(E(\zeit),D(\zeit),I(\zeit))$ and generalizations is illustrated by
a simpler case, the \KSe, in \refsect{sec:moreObs}. I'll try to get to
the \NS\ case and the much better Gibson et al. coordinates, but it
is taking time...

\item[2011-10-24 Annalisa]
Still not convinced about the flow field per se. \refFig{f:111024layer1}
is a plot of the vorticity in the top layer at 4 different times during
which the energy is $\approx$ stable (at least the kinetic part, but
being dominant also the total is OK). The problem is that the structures I
see are always the same, they are just moving a bit. And this is going to
be the case with this channel once is equilibrated.

BTW, Lo Specchio  is theoretically right, but practically wrong.
Barotropic vortices can take a long time to dissipate. By that time,
everything else dissipated as well (\ie, any residual perturbation of the
flow field) and there is nothing on which the baroclinic instability will
be able to feed upon (if you start with zero perturbation field in the
Phillips model, you'll still end up with zero perturbation everywhere).

\item[2011-10-20 Predrag] I understand - they are sort of frozen in.
In spatiotemporal chaos it is one of the possible phases of an extended system,
but for weathermen like us, this is
no fun at all. There must be something to baroclinic instability that
I am missing - can it be that it is just a complicated transient? In that
case we might have to drive it by noisy surface winds, but that will be harder...

\item[2011-10-20 Predrag] Something quite different but of interest to me;
the reason you always see spirals in these $N$-layer models is that locally
$2D$ fluid mechanics is Euclidean-invariant? In a full $3D$ simulation these
vortices would still be there because of horizontal layers of fluid of equal density?
