Very nice indeed; if you could keep it below 25 pages that would make 
it easiest for volume volume, as it were.

As for the lack of humour in German academics, I don't know what you 
are talking about.

ES: That's funny.

subject	"Nonlinear Excursions", a special issue of Physica D in honour of 
Lou Howard.

	
Dear all,

Nonlinear Excursions

You are receiving this message in connection with the above special issue 
in Physica D, which follows on from the one-day meeting in celebration of 
Lou's 80th birthday in Woods Hole this summer.

Neil Balmforth and I are aiming to put together a nice volume with 
scientific articles ready for publication in mid 2010.  Hard-bound copies 
will be available to contributors.

This mailing list is somewhat broad in that it includes everyone who 
expressed an interest in contributing to the special volume, perhaps even 
in the weak sense of being in the neighbourhood when the topic was 
discussed.

If you do plan to submit to the special volume, please do the following:

1. Send a short message to me and Neil now, so that we can look out for 
your manuscript and prune the mailing list.

2. By January 31st, 2010, please submit your manuscript via the online 
system for Physica D.  This involves a login to 
http://ees.elsevier.com/physd and, crucially, selecting "SI: Nonlinear 
Excursions" from the drop-down menu regarding article type.  This way your 
manuscript will go down the right tube in the Elsevier bowel and reach us.  
The standard Physica D paper rules apply, in particular colour pages incur 
extra charges.  Shorter manuscripts are probably better than longer ones, 
though there is a lower page limit of 8 pages dictated by Elsevier.

All articles will be peer-reviewed and the deadline for receipt of the 
*final* manuscripts is July 1st 2010.
We are looking forward to receiving your manuscripts.

Kindest regards, Oliver & Neil.

Dear Predrag,

Very best,
Oliver.
