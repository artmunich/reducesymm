{\bf ES 2009-12-19 replaced:}
 On the other hand when one faces
nonlinear field theories\rf{chfield}, either classical or
quantum, the identification existense of order and organization
identified within the bewildering wealth of solutions. Dynamics
within the chaotic attractor of a low-dimensional, continuous
time, (state-space-)volume contracting flow can be in many
cases\rf{gilmore2003} understood by reduction to a discrete time map within a
Poincar\'e section. For sufficiently strong volume contraction
such a mapping provides a complete topological characterization
of the attractor\rf{gilmore2003}. Moreover the set of compact
invariant solutions, equilibria and periodic orbits, organize
the dynamics around them.

{\bf ES 2009-12-19 dropped: }
Nevertheless, many of the early examples of chaotic attractors where
observed in very drastic truncations of PDEs, such as the Lorenz flow\rf{lorenz}.
