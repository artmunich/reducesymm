% The usuall approach to symmetry reduction in low-dimensional dynamical systems
% is through rewritting of the dynamics in terms of a Hilbert basis, a linearly
% independent set of symmetry-invariant polynomials~\cite{GL-Gil07b,gatermannHab,ChossLaut00}.
% This approach works wonderfully for low-dimensional dynamics and an excellent reference
% on the subject is the Gilmore and Letellier monograph~\cite{GL-Gil07b}. As the dimension
% of  \statesp\ increases though the determination of a Hilbert basis becomes computationally
% prohibitive.
