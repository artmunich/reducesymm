The action of a symmetry group \Group\ on \pS\ endows the \statesp\ with the structure of a union of group orbits, each group orbit an equivalence class. The goal of {\em symmetry reduction} is the identification of a unique point as the representative of a group orbit, and the replacement of the original \statesp\ by the space of such points, the {\em \reducedsp}. In the literature this space is alternatively called
\emph{desymmetrized \statesp},
\emph{symmetry-reduced space},
\emph{orbit space}, or \emph{quotient space}
$\pS/\Group$ because symmetry has been `divided out.'
{The} symmetry group \Group\ of equivariant dynamics acts trivially in {the} \reducedsp, and the resulting dynamical system, called by Gilmore and Lettelier\rf{GL-Gil07b} the \emph{image}, is symmetry {\em invariant}, in the sense that its symmetry group is the identity. The mapping {of}  equivariant dynamics to invariant dynamics is implemented by methods such as
{\em \mframes},
{\em \mslices} or {\em \csection s}, or
{\em Hilbert bases}.

In \refsect{s:Hilbert} we briefly review one of the standard tools by which spatial symmetry reduction can be achieved: projection to a Hilbert basis, and show in \refsect{s:cLeHilbert} how it works for \cLf. A wonderful symmetry reduction tool for low-dimensional flows, the Hilbert basis approach turns out to be too cumbersome to be applicable to high-dimensional flows. Next we describe the \mframes\ (\refsect{sec:mf}) and apply it to the \cLf\ example to illustrate the form of a general linear slice (\refsect{sec:CLeMovFr}), show how the \mframes\ enables us to explicitly compute \Group-invariant coordinates, and relate these to the Hilbert invariant polynomial basis (\refsect{s:cleCoordSlice}). Then we discus different choices of slice-fixing points (\refsect{s:mfReqb}), and the associated singular sets (\refsect{s:laserMFnum}). Finally, in \refsect{sec:MovFrameODE}, we recast the essentially post-processing \mframes\ in the equivalent differential form, the \mslices, with dynamical equations restricted to the \reducedsp.


\section{\label{s:Hilbert} Hilbert polynomial bases}

In atomic physics, geophysics and other
low-dimensional physical problems with spatial symmetries,
symmetry reduction is customarily implemented just as we
did it in \refeq{eq:CartToPol}, by going to the `natural'
coordinate system (polar, cylindrical, \etc). That works well
for linear systems, but not so well for nonlinear flows;
note, for example, that these coordinate transformations
introduce non-physical singularities
in \refeq{eq:PolarCLeTheta} at $r_1=0$ and $r_2=0$.

What are we really doing when redefining dynamics in terms of
such invariant coordinates? We are recasting equivariant
dynamics of $(\ssp_1,\ssp_2,\cdots)$ coordinates in terms of
rotationally invariant lengths
$(r_1=(\ssp_1^2+\ssp_2^2)^2,\cdots)$, volumes and other
invariant quantities. Indeed, the problem of symmetry
reduction {was} elegantly solved nearly a century ago.
Physical laws should have the same form in
symmetry-equivalent coordinate frames, so they are often
formulated in terms of functions (Hamiltonians, Lagrangians,
$\cdots$) {that are} invariant under a given set of symmetries. Given a
symmetry, what is the most general functional form of such
law? According to the Hilbert-Weyl theorem, for a compact
group $\Group$ there exists a finite $\Group${-invariant}
Hilbert polynomial basis $\{u_1,u_2, \dots,u_m\}$, $ m \geq
d$, such that any $\Group${-invariant} polynomial can be
written as a multinomial
\beq
h(\ssp) = p(u_1(\ssp),u_2(\ssp), \dots,u_m(\ssp))
    \,,\qquad \ssp \in \pS
\,.
\ee{HilbWeyl}
{The} Gilmore and Lettelier monograph\rf{GL-Gil07b} offers
a very clear, detailed and user friendly discussion of
symmetry reduction by means of Hilbert polynomial bases (do
not look for `Hilbert' in the index, though).
The dynamical equations follow from the chain rule
\beq
 \dot{ u}_i=\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} \, \dot{x}_j
 \,,
\ee{HilbChainRl}
upon substitution $\{x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_d\}$ $\to$
$\{u_1,u_2,\cdots,u_m\}$. One can either rewrite the dynamics
in this basis, or one can simply plot the `image' of
solutions computed in the original, equivariant basis in
terms of these invariant polynomials.

Unfortunately, while the idea is elegant, an explicit
construction of $\Group${-invariant} basis can in practice be
a laborious undertaking. One trades in the equivariant
\statesp\ coordinates $\{x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_d\}$ for a
non-unique set  of $m \geq d$ invariant polynomials
$\{u_1,u_2,\cdots,u_m\}$. These polynomials are linearly
independent, but functionally dependent through $m - d + N$
nonlinear relations called \emph{syzygies}. Their
determination becomes quickly computationally prohibitive as
the dimension of the system and/or group
increases\rf{gatermannHab,ChossLaut00}, and in practice
typical computations are confined to dimensions less than
ten. As our goal is to quotient continuous symmetries of
high-dimensional flows, high meaning $10^2$-$10^6$ coupled
ODEs, such as those arising from truncations of the \KS\ and
Navier-Stokes flows, {Hilbert basis reduction} is
at present not a feasible option.

Nevertheless, as symmetry reduction of moderate-dimension
flows by the method of invariant polynomials offers a clean
benchmark for other approaches symmetry-reduction, we start
by showing how it works for \cLf.
