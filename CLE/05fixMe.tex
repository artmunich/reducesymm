\section*{To fix}

{\bf remove these as you fix them:}

ES: Physica D seems to require corresponding author to be designated by $\backslash$corref, but I cannot get it to work

ES: Set of figures to be included seems complete now, I will try to polish appearance an optimize file size.
    PDF versions do not look right, so I might as well export a pdf copy of each figure for the final publication.

ES: Make sure cLe and not CLemacro is used throughout.
ES: Homogenize group theoretical notation, group, isotropy subgroup etc, convert to ChaosBook.
