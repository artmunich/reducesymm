\section{To fix}

{\bf move these down as you fix them:}

PC 2010-01-26 - template says:
\begin{verbatim}
Use \appendix* if there only one appendix.
\end{verbatim}
but I do not see how to do it.
ES: Neither do I.

defsCLE.tex  2010-01-26 contains this:
\begin{verbatim}
\renewcommand\Poincare{Poincar\'e}
  % ES: It is {Poincar\'e } in ChaosBook, is this on purpose?
  % PC it's the same symbol, no?
  % ES: There is a trailing space in contrast to most macros.
  % No major issue, I'm just used to add an extra \ after macros
  % and with this it looks like too much white space.
\end{verbatim}

ES: Physica D seems to require corresponding author to be
designated by $\backslash$corref, but I cannot get it to work

ES: Set of figures to be included seems complete now, I will
try to polish appearance an optimize file size. PDF versions
do not look right, so I might as well export a pdf copy of
each figure for the final publication.


---------------------------------- BibTeX -------------

../bibtex/siminos.bib
\\
Warning--I didn't find a database entry for "endnote50"

ES: cannot find this warning somewhere
(PC: me neither, at the moment)

\section*{Fixed}

ES: Make sure cLe and not CLe macro is used throughout.
