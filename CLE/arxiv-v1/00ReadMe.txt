arXiv submission notes
----------------------

PACS replaced by AMS codes (ES: in KS paper, stick with PACS here?)
    [] 

remove all footnotes and "edits" from the submission copy
    [x] mark here when done

remove all % commented and incriminating text from the submission copy
    [x] mark here when done

remove extraneous macros from defsCLE.tex before submission
    [x] mark here when done (ES: do we have a script for this? I've tried but its not easy.)

svn rm  [all unused *.tex and other files]
    [x] mark here when done 

svn rm  [all unused figures and all *.pdf]
    [x] mark here when done 

Set bibstyle to alphabetical order, temporarily,
        and check for double entries.
    [x] mark here when done

does PhysD want spaces between the initials?
PC fixed that once by using   bibclean fluid.bib; redo:
    [x] mark here when done (ES just let space be)

at submission do not submit the {\tt .bib} file, 
submit the completed CLE.bbl file, having used appropriate bibliographic
style file. [or the hyperref version, with eprint]
    [x] mark here when done

Consistent use of $\ldots$, (I)/(a)/(1)/itemize, others?
    [x] mark here when done

    [x] PostScript figures generated with sufficient
       line thickness? 

svn copy all used and cleaned-up source files and figs from
CLE to  arxiv-v1/
    [x] mark here when done

submit to arXiv.org
    [x] created CLE.tex for arXiv submission
    arxiv-v1/*.tex *.bst *.cls figs/*.eps CLE.bbl
	  ES: Do we really need *.bst, *.cls?
    [x] mark here and date when done: ES June-11-2010


!!! then DO NOT TOUCH arxiv-v1/* again, do all edits in CLE/
===============================================================



Fix these:
----------
  check http://arxiv.org/hypertex/bibstyles/ for hyperref compatible
  BiBTeX styles

ES: Not sure h-elsevier.bst in arXiv is the one we need here. I'll try.

ELECTRONIC PREPRINTS	

    * Preprint of an article doesn't count as prior publication
    * Authors don't have to remove electronic preprints from publicly accessible
servers
    * Articles are edited and peer-reviewed to give the quality the audience
expects

 
Our Attitude
Elsevier is liberal with respect to authors and electronic preprints. Unlike
some publishers, we do not consider that a preprint of an article (including a
prior version as a thesis) prior to its submission to Elsevier for consideration
amounts to prior publication, which would disqualify the work from consideration
for re-publication in a journal. We also do not require authors to remove
electronic preprints from publicly accessible servers (including the author's
own home page) once an article has been accepted for publication. Further, we
have announced in May 2004 a change in policy that facilitates institutional
repositories by permitting authors to revise their personal versions of their
papers to reflect changes made in the peer review process. This new policy
permits authors to post such revised personal versions on their own web sites
and the sites of their institutions, provided a link to the journal is included.

Our policy however is that the final published version of the article as it
appears in the journal will continue to be available only on an Elsevier site.

Peer Reviewing - Seal of Approval
The scientific communication process revolves around the peer review process and
the question of what the scientific record is. Researchers need to know when
they obtain an Elsevier journal article that it is the article as published,
that is, as having been edited and peer reviewed in conformity with the quality
that the researcher associates with that particular journal. Having the final
published article on an Elsevier server provides the integrity seal of approval
for researchers.

Our Role
Elsevier's competitive interest is to ensure that we can invest in the
technological resources for electronic distribution, to facilitate the
digitization of the material, linking and cross-referencing, and easy access and
searching. Elsevier has made substantial investments in such technologies over
the past several years, and exclusivity with respect to the electronic
distribution of the form of article as published will we believe permit Elsevier
to cover these costs and ensure a profit, which ultimately means the success of
such systems.

Fundamentally the point concerns the role of publisher. The publisher is
responsible for registering and ensuring quality, and this accreditation role
continues to be of vital importance to science.
