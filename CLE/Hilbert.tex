\subsection{\label{s:cLeHilbert} An example: \CLe\ recast in Hilbert basis}

As the Hilbert basis approach turns out to be too cumbersome
for our main goal, symmetry reduction of high-dimensional
flows, we shall not attempt to describe how to construct
invariant polynomials basis systematically. Pedagogical
literature mostly focuses on discrete symmetry
groups\rf{GL-Gil07b,gatermannHab,ChossLaut00}, while general
algorithms are a domain of advanced algebraic geometry
monographs. For purpose at hand it suffices to use the
Gilmore and Letellier\rf{GL-Gil07b} invariant polynomial
basis for the action \refeq{CLfRots}. They apply it to
symmetry reduction of the Zeghlache-Mandel system\rf{ZeMa85},
a flow much like the \cLe. As it can be easily verified, the
Hilbert basis
\bea
        u_1 &=& x_1^2+x_2^2\,,\qquad\qquad
        u_2 \,=\, y_1^2+y_2^2 \,,\continue
        u_3 &=& x_1 y_2-x_2 y_1\,,\qquad
        u_4 \,=\, x_1 y_1+x_2 y_2	\,,\continue
        u_5 &=& z
\label{eq:ipLaser}
\eea
is invariant under the $\SOn{2}$ action on a
5-dim\-ens\-ion\-al \statesp\ \refeq{CLfRots}. That implies,
in particular, that the image of the full \statesp\ \reqv\
\REQV{}{1} group orbit of \reffig{fig:CLE} is the
\eqv\ point \EQV{1} in \reffig{fig:CLEip}. The
five polynomials are linearly independent, but related through one
syzygy,
\beq
u_1 u_2 -u_3^2-u_4^2 =0
  \,,
\label{eq:syzLaser}
\eeq
yielding a 4-dim\-ens\-ion\-al $\pS/\SOn{2}$ \reducedsp,
a symmetry-invariant representation of the 5-dim\-ens\-ion\-al
\SOn{2} equivariant dynamics.

\dot{u}_5 &=&u_3-b\, u_5\,.

As far as visualization goes, we need neither construct nor
integrate the invariant dynamics \refeq{eq:CLEip}. It
suffices to integrate the original, unreduced flow of
\refFig{fig:CLE}, but plot the solution in the image space,
\ie, $u_i$ invariant, Hilbert polynomial coordinates, as in
\reffig{fig:CLEip}. A minor drawback of the Hilbert
polynomial basis projections is that the folding mechanism is
harder to view since the dynamics is squeezed near the
$z$-axis.

We can now easily identify a suitable Poincar\'e
section as one that contains the $z$-axis and
the \reqv, here defined by the condition $u_1=u_4$\ES{explain}.
Even though in \cLe\ case we could use one of the $u_i$'s as
a coordinate to construct a return map, for more general flows
a dynamically intrinsic parametrization is needed.
Following \refref{Christiansen97} we construct the first return map
of \reffig{fig:CLEipRM} using as coordinate the
Euclidean length along the intersection of the unstable
manifold of \REQV{}{1} with the Poincar\'e surface of section,
measured from \REQV{}{1}, as described in \refsect{s:Poincare}.
    \PC{make sure \REQV{}{1} is used consistently: think someplace
    label $E_0$ pops up...
    }


\subsection{\label{s:Poincare}Symmetry reduced return map}

Successive trajectory intersections with a {\em Poincar\'e
section}, a $(d-1)$-dim\-ens\-ion\-al hypersurface
\ES{use term hypersurface instead of submanifold also for
slices?}
or a set of
hypersurfaces $\PoincS$ embedded in the $d$-dim\-ens\-ion\-al
{\statesp} $\pS$, define the {\em Poincar\'e return map}
$\PoincM({\ssp})$, a $(d-1)$-dim\-ens\-ion\-al map of form
\index{map!return}
\index{Poincar\'e return map}
\PC{draw figure}
\index{first return function}
\beq
\ssp' = \PoincM({\ssp})
          =  \flow{\tau(\ssp)}{\ssp}
\,,\qquad
\ssp', \ssp \in \PoincS
\,.
\ee{PoincMap}
Here the {\em first return function} $\tau(\ssp)$--sometimes
referred to as the {\em ceiling function}--is the time of
flight to the next section for a trajectory starting at $\ssp$.
The choice of the section hypersurface $\PoincS$ is altogether
arbitrary. \ES{enter some criteria for our choice. Draw section
in invariant polynomial figures.}

We begin by sprinkling evenly points
$\{\ssp^{(1)},\ssp^{(2)},\cdots,\ssp^{(N-1)}\}$ between the
\reqv\ point $\ssp_{\REQV{}{1}}=\ssp^{(0)}$ and point  $\ssp=
\ssp^{(N)}$, along the $1d$ intersection of \Poincare\ section and
unstable manifold continuation $\ssp^{(k)} \in \hat{W}^u_{(1)}$ of the unstable ${\bf
\hat{e}}^{(1)}$ eigen\-plane (we shall omit the
eigen\-direction label ${}_{(1)}$ in what follows). Then the
arclength in Euclidean metric (for the luck of a more natural metric)
from \reqv\ point $\ssp_{\REQV{}{1}}=\ssp^{(0)}$ to $\ssp=
\ssp^{(N)}$ is given by
% \beq
% s^2 = \lim_{N\to\infty}
%            \sum_{k=1}^N g_{ij} \, d\ssp^{(k)}_i d\ssp^{(k)}_j
% \,,\qquad
%         d\ssp^{(k)}_i = \ssp^{(k)}_i - \ssp^{(k-1)}_i
% \,.
% \ee{arcLength}
% For the lack of a better idea
% (perhaps the dynamically determined $g = \jMps^T\jMps$
% would be a more natural metric?)
% let us measure arclength in the Euclidian metric,
% $g_{ij} = \delta_{ij}$, so
\beq
s = \lim_{N\to\infty}
         \sqrt{
            \sum_{k=1}^N \left(d\ssp^{(k)}\right)^2
              }
\,.
\ee{EuclArcl}
By definition $f^{\tau(\ssp)}(\ssp) \in \hat{W}^u_{(j)}$, so
$f^t(\ssp)$ induces a $1d$ map $s(s_0,\tau) =
s(f^{\tau(\xInit)}(\xInit))$.

{\em \Turn s} are points on the unstable
manifold for which the local unstable manifold curvature diverges
for forward iterates of the map, \ie, points at which the manifold
folds back onto itself arbitrarily sharply.
For our purposes,
approximate \turn s suffice.
The $1d$ curve $\hat{W}^u_{(1)}$ starts out linear at
$\ssp_{\REQV{}{1}}$, then gently curves until it folds back sharply
at `\turn' along a possible heteroclinic connection to \EQV{0}
and then nearly retraces itself.

The trick is to figure out a good {\em base segment} to the
nearest {\turn} $L=[0,s_{b}]$, and after the foldback assign
to $s(\ssp,t)>s_{b}$ the nearest point $s$ on the base
segment. Since here the stable manifold contraction is strong, the
2nd coordinate connecting $s(\ssp,t) \to s$ can be neglected.

Armed with this intrinsic curvilinear coordinate
parametrization, we are now in a position to construct a
1-dimensional model of the dynamics on the \nws. If
$\hat{\ssp}_n$ is the $n$th Poincar\'e section of a
trajectory in neighborhood of $\ssp_\stagn$, and $s_n$ is the
corresponding curvilinear coordinate, then $s_{n+1} = f^{\tau_n}(s_n)$
models the full \statesp\ dynamics $\hat{\ssp}_n \to
\hat{\ssp}_{n+1}$. We approximate $f(s_n)$ by a smooth,
continuous 1-dimensional map $f : L_\stagn \to L_\stagn$ by taking
$\hat{\ssp}_n \in L_\stagn$, and assigning to
$\hat{\ssp}_{n+1}$ the nearest base segment point
$s_{n+1}=s(\hat{\ssp}_{n+1})$. The return map turns out to
be unimodal, binary symbolic dynamics are easily constructed
and fixed points of the map up to length
$7$ systematically obtained. A multiple shooting routine is then
used to determine the corresponding relative periodic orbits of
\cLe\ to machine precision.
