%\subsection{\label{s:Hilbert}Hilbert basis approach}

The most common approach to symmetry reduction is through the
use of a Hilbert basis of invariant polynomials. One computes
a (non-unique) basis of linearly independent polynomials,
invariant under the action of the symmetry group (\cf
\refref{gatermannHab,ChossLaut00} for a discussion of
methods) and either rewrites the dynamics in this basis or
maps the solutions to the polynomials.
The reader is referred to the book of Gilmore and
Lettelier\rf{GL-Gil07b} for a very detailed discussion of
symmetry reduction, through the use of invariant polynomials\ES{Also Chossat and Lauterbach?}.

It will be convenient to rewrite the system in real variables
$x=x_1+ i\, x_2\,,\ y=y_1+i\, x_2$ as
\beq
\begin{split}
	\dot{x}_1 &= -\sigma x_1 + \sigma y_1\cont
	\dot{x}_2 &= -\sigma x_2 + \sigma y_2\cont
	\dot{y}_1 &= (\RerCLor-z) x_1 - \ImrCLor x_2 -y_1-e y_2 \cont
	\dot{y}_2 &= \ImrCLor x_1 + (\RerCLor-z) x_2 + e y_1- y_2\cont
	\dot{z} \; &= -b z + x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2\,.
	\label{eq:CLeR}
\end{split}
\eeq

The action \refeq{eq:SO2cle} of $\SOn{2}$ on $\Rls{5}$ is then given by
\beq
	X \mapsto  \Rot{\theta}X\,,
	\label{eq:SO2act}
\eeq
where
\beq
	\Rot{\theta}=	\left(\barr{ccccc}
				\cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) & 0	   & 0		    & 0\\
				\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)  & 0	   & 0		    & 0\\		
				0	     & 	0	     & \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) & 0\\
				0	     &  0	     & \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) & 0\\
				0	     &  0	     & 0	    & 0		   & 1\\	
			\earr\right)\,,\ \ \theta\in[0,2\pi)\,,
    \label{eq:RotCLe5d}
\eeq
and $X=(x_1\,,\ x_2\,,\ y_1\,,\ y_2\,,\ z)$.

\cLe\ takes the form
\beq
\begin{split}
 \dot{x}_1 &= -\sigma x_1 + \sigma y_1\cont
 \dot{x}_2 &= -\sigma x_2 + \sigma y_2\cont
 \dot{y}_1 &= (\rho_1-z) x_1 -\rho_2 x_2 -y_1 -e y_2\cont
 \dot{y}_2 &= (\rho_1-z) x_2 +\rho_2 x_1 -y_2 +e y_1\cont
 \dot{z} &= x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 -b z\,.	
\end{split}
\eeq
Gilmore and Letellier\rf{GL-Gil07b} compute a Hilbert basis
for the action \refeq{eq:SO2act} of $\SOn{2}$ on \Rls{5}  
and use it for symmetry reduction of a system conjugate to \cLe, 
with $e=-\ImrCLor$. It reads
\beq
\begin{split}
	u_1 &= x_1^2+x_2^2 \cont
	u_2 &= y_1^2+y_2^2 \cont
	u_3 &= x_1 y_2-x_2 y_1\cont
	u_4 &= x_1 y_1+x_2 y_2\cont
	u_5 &= z\,.
	\label{eq:ipLaser}
\end{split}
\eeq
As often the case with Hilbert bases the $u_i$'s are linearly 
independent but often functionally dependent through 
\beq
 	u_1u_2 -u_3^2-u_4^2 =0\,.
	\label{eq:syzLaser}
\eeq
Such a relation is called a syzygy and its presence corresponds to the fact
that symmetry reduction leads to state space dimension reduction by the
dimension of the group, here one.

We use the chain rule
\beq
 \dot{u}_i=\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}\dot{x}_j
 \,,
\ee{ChainRul}
and express the result in invariant polynomials:
    \ES{mathematica notebook:CLEtransfJac.nb
    {\bf PC:} Changed $z$ to $u_5$; have not checked the algebra}\
    \ES{Rechecked algebra by hand, keeping $\rho_2\neq 0$. $u_3$ and $u_4$ where permuted. I will have to check
		the figures for consistency.}
\beq
\begin{split}
  \dot{u}_1 &=2\,\sigma\,(u_4-u_1)\,,\\
  \dot{u}_2 &=-2\left(\,u_2 - \rho_2\, u_3 -\,(\rho_1-u_5)\,u_4\right)\,,\\
  \dot{u}_3 &=-(\sigma\, +1)\,u_3+\rho_2\, u_1+e\, u_4\,,\\
  \dot{u}_4 &=-(\sigma\, +1)\,u_4+\,(\rho_1-u_5)\,u_1+\sigma\, u_2-e\,u_3\,,\\
  \dot{u}_5 &=u_4-b\, u_5\,.
\end{split}
\label{eq:CLEip}
\eeq
For visualization purposes, rather than \ESedit{integrating
\refeq{eq:CLEip}, we map solutions of \refeq{eq:CLe} to the
$u_i$'s}, \reffig{fig:CLEip}. In most projections the folding
mechanism is hidden from view since the dynamics is squeezed
near the $z$-axis.

Nevertheless we can now easily identify a suitable Poincar\'e
section as one that contains the $z$-axis and
the \reqv, here defined by the condition $u_1=u_4$.
We construct the first return map using as coordinate the
Euclidean length along the intersection of the unstable
manifold of \REQV{}{1} with the Poincar\'e surface of section,
measured from \REQV{}{1}, see \reffig{fig:CLEipRM}.

When one takes syzygies into account in rewriting the
dynamical system, singularities are introduced. For instance
if we solve \refeq{eq:syzLaser} for $u_2$ and substitute into \refeq{eq:CLEip}
the latter reads
\beq
\begin{split}
  \dot{u}_1 &=2\,\sigma\,(u_4-u_1)\,,\\
  \dot{u}_2 &=-2\left(\,\frac{u_3^2+u_4^2}{u_1} - \rho_2\, u_3 -\,(\rho_1-u_5)\,u_4\right)\,,\\
  \dot{u}_3 &=-(\sigma\, +1)\,u_3+\rho_2\, u_1+e\, u_4\,,\\
  \dot{u}_4 &=-(\sigma\, +1)\,u_4+\,(\rho_1-u_5)\,u_1+\sigma\, \frac{u_3^2+u_4^2}{u_1}-e\,u_3\,,\\
  \dot{u}_5 &=u_4-b\, u_5\,
\end{split}
\label{eq:CLEipSyz}
\eeq
clearly singular as $u_2\rightarrow 0$. 


Moreover when
one \emph{lifts} the dynamics from the quotient space
$\Manif/G$ to the original space $\Manif$ the transformations
have singularities at the \fixedsp s of
the isotropy subgroups in $\Manif$, in the optimal case, \cf
\refref{GL-Gil07b}. Those singularities do not seem to
restrict our ability to use invariant polynomials to obtain
symmetry reduced projections of the dynamics.

What restricts the utility of Hilbert basis methods is that the
determination of a Hilbert basis becomes computationally
prohibitive as the dimension of the system or of the group
increases\rf{gatermannHab,ChossLaut00} and typically
computations are constrained to dimension smaller than ten. As
our goal is to quotient continuous symmetries of
high-dimensional flows, specifically those arising from
truncations of the \KS\ and Navier-Stokes flows
and thus we need an efficient framework.
