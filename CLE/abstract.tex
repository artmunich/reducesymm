Two approaches to continuous symmetry reduction suited to
reducing higher- and even very
high-dimensional dissipative flows to local return maps are
presented. In the Hilbert polynomial basis approach 
\ES{I did not try to focus in Hilbert basis approach as it 
is well described elsewhere and I think it is not applicable to very
high-dimensional flows due to computational
restrictions in determination of the basis. It is included for
comparison purposes and completeness. We also don't offer any
details on how to compute a basis systematically as it would 
take up too much space to describe it properly: even in Gilmore 
and Letelier\rf{GL-Gil07b} details are not clear for the compact 
group case, Chossat and Lauterbach\rf{ChossLaut00} focus on discrete groups, 
only advanced algebraic geometry books provide the algorithms and
I think also Gatermann\rf{gatermannHab}. I think in the abstract
we should mention comparison to Hilbert basis approach but do not
treat it as something that can be used at present for symmetry
reduction in high dimensions.}
the
equivariant dynamics is rewritten in terms of invariant
coordinates. In the method of moving frames the state space
is `sliced' locally in such a way that each group orbit of
symmetry-equivalent points is represented by a single point.
In either approach numerical computations can be performed in
the original, full state-space representation, and then the
solutions can be projected onto the symmetry reduced state
space. The two methods are illustrated by
reduction of the complex Lorenz system, a 5-dimensional
dissipative flow with rotational symmetry.
