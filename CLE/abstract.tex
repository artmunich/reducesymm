We present methods of continuous symmetry reduction for the purpose of reducing the dynamics to local
return maps and with emphasis in applicability to high-dimensional flows. 
We demonstrate various methods in the example of a five-dimensional, dissipative system
with rotational symmetry , the complex Lorenz equations. Methods that identify 
the reduced state-space with a submanifold of the state-space introduce
singularities for most interesting symmetries and are bound to succeed only locally. 
Nevertheless, we propose that such local methods can be used for
efficient construction of symmetry reduced return maps even for very high-dimensional
flows.
