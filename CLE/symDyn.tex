% symmetry in dynamical systems

We consider a system of \ode s of the form
\beq
	\dot{\ssp} = \vf(\ssp)
	\label{eq:difeq}
\eeq
where $\vf: \Rls{n} \rightarrow \Rls{n}$ a $C^\infty$ mapping.

We call a group element $\gamma\in\On{n}$ a symmetry of
\refeq{eq:difeq} if for every solution $x(t)$, $\gamma x(t)$
is also a solution. Equivalently $\gamma$ is a symmetry of \refeq{eq:difeq}:
\beq
	\vf(\gamma x) =\gamma \vf(x)
	\label{eq:equiv}
\eeq
for all $x\in\Rls{n}$. We say that $\vf$ \emph{commutes} with
$\gamma$ or that $\vf$ is $\gamma$-\emph{equivariant}. When
$\vf$ commutes with all $\gamma\in\Group$ we say that $\vf$
is $\Group$-equivariant. The finite time flow
$\flow{t}{\gamma x_o}$ through $\gamma x_o$ satisfies the
equivariance condition $\flow{t}{\gamma x_o}=\gamma
\flow{t}{x_o}$ from definition of symmetry and uniqueness of
solutions. In physics literature the term $invariant$ is most
commonly used, mostly because in Hamiltonian systems symmetry
is manifested as invariance of the Hamiltonian under the
symmetry operation.

\CLe\ are equivariant under the one parameter rotation
group $\Un{1}\cong\SOn{2}$ acting by
\beq
	(x,\,y,\,z)\mapsto (e^{i\theta}x,\,e^{i\theta}y,\,z)\,,\ \theta\in[0,2\pi]\,.
\eeq 
\ES{In this representation equivariance is easy to check but here we should
also discuss infinitesimal generator.}

The systems that we study here are not associated with a variational principle. Therefore
Noether's theorem does not apply and we  cannot conclude the existence of a conserved quantity associated
with a continuous symmetry of the system. Such a conserved quantity would restrict dynamical
trajectories to an invariant manifold locally transverse to the direction of group action.
In the contrary here the system also evolves along the direction of group action. In the example of {\CLe}
this is demonstrated in \reffig{fig:CLE}, where we project trajectories in $(x_1,x_2,z)$ axes, 
where $x=x_1+ i\, x_2\,,\ y=y_1+i\, x_2$ with $x_i,\,y_i\in\Rls{}$. In this projection a generic 
trajectory can be seen as one that traces a Lorenz-butterfly like attractor while at the same time slowly
``drifting'' along the direction of rotations. \refFig{fig:CLE} also illustrates the need for continuous symmetry 
reduction as a prerequisite for an understanding of state space geometry of such systems. 
The lowest level of organization of the familiar (real) Lorenz system that does not posses a continuous symmetry
can be understood\rf{DasBuch,SiminosThesis} in terms of the unstable manifolds of the equilibrium at the origin 
and the two (discrete-symmetry-related) equilibria $\EQB{1,2}$. In the case of {\CLe}  the origin \EQB{0} 
is an \eqv\ of \refeq{eq:CLe} for any
value of the parameters. As shown in \refref{FowlerCLE82} it
is stable for $0<\RerCLor<\rho_{1c}$ and unstable for
$\rho_{1c}<\RerCLor$, where
\beq
	\rho_{1c} = 1 + \frac{(e+\ImrCLor)(e-\sigma \ImrCLor)}{(\sigma+1)^2}\,.
\eeq
At bifurcation a pair of eigenvalues crosses the imaginary axis with imaginary part:
\beq
	\omega_c = \frac{\sigma (e + \ImrCLor)}{\sigma+1}\,.
	\label{eq:omegaCLE}
\eeq
and a \emph{relative equilibrium} \REQB{1}, an equilibrium in a frame rotating with constant angular velocity
is born. Alternatively we might say that a relative equilibrium is a periodic orbit that is invariant (as a set)
under the action of $\LGelement{l_p}\in\Group$ for any $l_p$\ES{this implies constant angular velocity by equivariance.}.
\ES{Does not fit here, but keep: For $e+\ImrCLor=0$ the relative equilibrium degenerates to an \SOn{2}-orbit of 
\eqva\rf{FowlerCLE82}, since $\omega_c =0$.}  As we will see in \refsect{s:StabReq}, \REQB{1} of {\CLe} for 
the parameter set we study here is unstable with one complex expanding eigenvalue. Yet, being a periodic
orbit, its unstable manifold is three-dimensional, with one eigendirection corresponding
to the direction of $\vf$ which also coinsides with the direction of rotations of the system. 
In \reffig{fig:CLE} we plot one trajectory on the unstable manifold of \REQB{1}. While it spirals away
from $\REQB{1}$ it also ``drifts'' along the direction of rotations of the system. This drifting motion obscures 
understanding of the stretching mechanism along the expanding eigendirection and subsequently the folding of the
unstable manifold back to itself.

The next (or a complimentary) level of organization of (real) {\Le} attractor
is provided by the dense set of \po s embedded in it\rf{DV03,DasBuch}. In {\CLe}
a secondary bifurcation from \REQB{1} is expected, according
to Krupa's theorem\rf{Krupa90}, to result in
\emph{relative periodic orbits} that satisfy
\beq
	\LGelement{l_p}x(t+T_p)=x(t)\,,
\eeq
{\ie} they ``return'' after a time period $T_p$ to a point that maps to the initial one
under a group transformation $\LGelement{l_p}$ with group parameter period $l_p$.
A {\rpo} of {\CLe} is shown in \reffig{fig:CLE} as its iterations fill a torus. Therefore
we see that in systems with continuous symmetry we have to account for tori instead of {\po s}
as the organizational blocks of the attractor. 

\subsection{{\CLe} \reqva}

We rewrite the system in real variables
$x=x_1+ i\, x_2\,,\ y=y_1+i\, x_2$ as

\beq
\begin{split}
	\dot{x}_1 &= -\sigma x_1 + \sigma y_1\cont
	\dot{x}_2 &= -\sigma x_2 + \sigma y_2\cont
	\dot{y}_1 &= (\RerCLor-z) x_1 - \ImrCLor x_2 -y_1-e y_2 \cont
	\dot{y}_2 &= \ImrCLor x_1 + (\RerCLor-z) x_2 + e y_1- y_2\cont
	\dot{z} \; &= -b z + x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2\,.
	\label{eq:CLeR}
\end{split}
\eeq


In this section we turn to the ``laser case''
$e\neq0,\;\ImrCLor=0$; in the numerical examples we set the
detuning to $e=1/10$.
% \refFig{fig:CLE} illustrates the need
% to project dynamics on \reducedsp: Dynamics is organized by
% the interplay of the stable and unstable manifolds of \eqv\
% \EQB{0} and \reqv\ \REQB{1} but the dynamics along the
% direction of rotation blur the picture and the notion of
% recurrence becomes relative. We will present various
% approaches to orbit space reduction in the following
% sections.

To find the location of the \reqv\ it is convenient to work
on polar coordinates defined by $x=r_1 e^{i \phi_1},\,y=r_2
e^{i \phi_2}$. Equations \refeq{eq:CLe} with $\ImrCLor=0$
take the form
    %PC: Rebecca and I rederived these: they check.
\PC{
    Replaced parameter $r_i$ by $\{\ImrCLor,\ImrCLor\}$
    so the radial coordinates become $r_i$, as in the Lorentz examples.
    Replaced $\Phi$ by $\phi$ - looks prettier to me.}
\beq
\begin{split}
	\dot{r}_1 &=-\sigma (r_1 - r_2\cos\phi) \cont
	\dot{r}_2 &=-r_2 + r_1(\RerCLor -z)\cos\phi \cont
	\dot{z} &=  -b z+r_1 r_2\cos\phi \cont	
	\dot{\phi} &=-e-\frac{\sigma r_2 \sin\phi}{r_1}-\frac{r_1(\RerCLor-z) \sin\phi }{r_2}\,,
	\label{eq:CLePolar}
\end{split}
\eeq
where $\phi=\phi_1-\phi_2$ and the evolution equations for $\phi_1,\phi_2$ are given by
\beq
\begin{split}
	\dot{\phi}_1 &=-\frac{\sigma r_2 \sin\phi}{r_1}\cont
	\dot{\phi_2} &= e +\frac{r_1 (\RerCLor -z)\sin\phi}{r_2}\,.
	\label{eq:CLeAngl}
\end{split}
\eeq
The condition for a \reqv~ is that all time derivatives in \refeq{eq:CLePolar} vanish from which we get
% Explicit form here, simplified in terms of z component below
% \beq
% \begin{split}
% 	z &= -\frac{e^2}{(\sigma +1)^2}+\RerCLor -1\cont
% 	r_2 &= \frac{\sqrt{-b \left(e^2+(\sigma +1)^2\right)\left(e^2-(\RerCLor -1) (\sigma +1)^2\right)}}{(\sigma+1)^2}\cont
% 	r_1 &= \frac{\sqrt{-b \left(e^2-(\RerCLor -1) (\sigma +1)^2\right)}}{\sigma +1}\cont
% 	\Phi &= -\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sigma +1}{\sqrt{e^2+(\sigma +1)^2}}\right)
% \end{split}
% \eeq
\beq
\begin{split}
	z^{(1)} &= \frac{-e^2+(\RerCLor -1)(\sigma +1)^2}{(\sigma +1)^2}\cont
	r_1^{(1)} &= \sqrt{b z^{(1)}}\cont
	r_2^{(1)} &= \sqrt{b \left(e^2+(\sigma +1)^2\right)z^{(1)}}\cont
	\phi^{(1)} &= -\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sigma +1}{\sqrt{e^2+(\sigma +1)^2}}\right)
\end{split}
\eeq
Substituting in \refeq{eq:CLeAngl} we get $\dot{\phi}_1=\dot{\phi}_2=e \sigma/(1 + \sigma)\neq 0$ for $e\neq0$
and thus we have indeed a \reqv, not a group orbit of \eqva.

Calculation  in polar coordinates $r_1,r_2,\phi,z$ of stability eigenvalues for \REQB{1}
for the set of parameters we use here yields
\beq
	\eigRe[1]\pm i\eigIm[1]= 0.0938\pm 10.1945i,\,
    \eigExp[3]=-11.0009,\, \eigExp[4]= -13.8534\,.
	\label{eq:CLeREQBstab}
\eeq
