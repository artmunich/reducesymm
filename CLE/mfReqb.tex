\subsection{\label{s:mfReqb}A slice at \reqv}

As became clear in \refsect{sec:mf}, the use of a coordinate \slice\ \refeq{eq:CLEsliceSO2} 
allowed explicit determination of the moving frame map \refeq{eq:CLEmf} and straightforward 
determination of invariant variables \refeq{eq:invLaser}. 
On the other hand \slice\ \refeq{eq:CLEsliceSO2} is defined to be orthogonal
to the group tangent of \SOn{2} restricted in the $x$-irreducible subspace of \SOn{2} 
and this introduces singularities in the transformations \refeq{eq:invLaser}.
Here we will remove this restriction to a coordinate \slice\ and therefore to 
an irreducible subspace and construct a moving frame by defining the slice to be orthogonal 
to the group orbit at a given point in space $\slicep$. The price to pay is that it 
won't be convenient to explicitly write out the transformations to invariant variables
as we did in \refsect{sec:mf}; we will instead implement the moving frame map numerically,
mapping computed trajectories to the \slice.

Specifically, we define a slice by
\beq
(\sspRed - \slicep ) \cdot \sliceTan_a =0
    \,,\qquad
\sliceTan_a  = \Lg_a \, \slicep
\,.
\ee{PCsectQ}
As $\slicep  \cdot \sliceTan_a =0$ by the antisymmetry of
$\Lg_a$, the slice condition \refeq{PCsectQ} determines
$\theta$ for a given $\ssp$ by
\beq
0 = \sspRed \cdot \Lg_a \, \slicep
  %= \LieEl(\theta) \cdot \hat{\ssp}   \cdot \Lg \cdot \slicep
	=\ssp \cdot \LieElrep_a(\theta)^T \Lg_a \, \slicep
\,.
\ee{PCsectQ1}

A generic point $\slicep $ not in an invariant subspace (on
the \CLe\ $z$ axis, for example) should suffice to fix a good
\slice. In our \cLe\ example we will choose a point on \reqv\ group orbit,
 $\slicep  = \ssp_{\REQB{1}}$. 
Each group intersects the section exactly twice,  with the
two solutions separated by $\pi$. We select the one \ESedit{
that is at the smallest Euclidean distance from $\slicep$.} 
\ES{replaced: with a
smaller clockwise rotation angle into the \slice.} \ES{dropped
as I am not sure it is correct for multiparameter groups. Even
for \cLe\ it seems to imply that the slice exists on the $z$-axis,
which I think is not true: The
invariant subspaces are always within the \slice, as $\Lg_a
 \ssp =0$ for $\ssp$ in an invariant subspace.
}
Projection of \cLe\ dynamics to the slice defined in this way are
shown in \reffig{fig:CLEmfReqb1}. We see that the problems of 
\reffig{fig:CLEmf} are not present in \reffig{fig:CLEmfReqb1}, since
the slice now is not defined only where the group action is not free,
that is in the set of points that are fixed by the group action. This
is the $z$-axis and as we have remarked it cannot be reached by generic
trajectories. We have to caution the reader that this is a fortuitous
event. For more general group representations symmetry reduction through
the use of a slice will be at best local as we intend to discuss 
elsewhere\rf{SCD09b}. Nevertheless, using local slices defined by \refeq{PCsectQ}
to tesselate the \reducedsp\ is an optimal choice in the sense that any
failure will occur in \fixedsp\ $\Fix{\LieElrep_a}$ of some subgroup
$\LieElrep_a$.
