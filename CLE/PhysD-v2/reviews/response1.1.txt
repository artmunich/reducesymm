CONTINUOUS SYMMETRY REDUCTION AND
RETURN MAPS FOR HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL FLOWS

by E. Siminos and P. Cvitanovic

This is an interesting paper. So much so that I have not wanted
to part with my review, and I apologize to the authors for
taking so long. The paper motivated me enough to follow up on
several of the references cited.

The paper is well-written and has a strong pedagogical
component - several ideas are explained quite well. The
discussion on symmetry is concise and understandable, with the
Lorenz flow serving as a illustrative (blissful) example.

I also enjoyed the the historical notes. Such discussions can
be dangerous - I have found inaccurate historical citations in
Cushman and Bates, for example. But, I have no beefs with the
citations of this paper.

The meat of the paper is a comparison using the Lorenz model
between reduction based on invariant polynomials versus that of
Cartan's moving frames. I had studied Hilbert's theorem from a
purely algebraic perspective, and it was very gratifying to see
it used in the context of this paper.

In several places it is mentioned that results apply to compact
groups. However, the semidirect product Galilean group which is
physically relevant is not compact. The authors might comment
a bit further about this.

Response:

Thank you for this observation, we have now included a short discussion
of noncompact groups and the reasons we focus on compact groups in 
section 2 of the manuscript.
