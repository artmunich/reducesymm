\section{\label{s:symSol} Symmetries of solutions}

In order to explore the implications of equivariance for the
solutions of dynamical equations,  we start by examining the
way a compact Lie group acts on \statesp\ \pS. The
\emph{group orbit} or the \emph{$\Group$-orbit} of the point
$\ssp \in \pS$ is the set
\beq
    \pS_\ssp = \{\LieEl\,\ssp \mid \LieEl \in {\Group}\}
\ee{GroupOrb}
of all \statesp\ points into which $\ssp$ is mapped under the
action of $\Group$.
The \emph{symmetry} $\stab{\ssp}$ (\emph{isotropy} or
\emph{stabilizer} group) of a \statesp\ point $\ssp$ is the
largest subgroup of $\Group$
\beq
\stab{\ssp} =\{\LieEl \in \Group: \LieEl \ssp = \ssp \}
\ee{def:isotr}
that leaves $\ssp$ fixed.
The \emph{symmetry} $\stab{X}$ of a set $\pS_X \in \pS$ is
the largest subgroup  of $\Group$ that leaves $\pS_X$
invariant as a set:
\[
	\stab{X}= \{\LieEl: \LieEl \, \pS_X = \pS_X\}
\,.
\]
If $\stab{p}$ is a symmetry, intrinsic properties of a
solution $\pS_p$ (such as \eqv\ or a cycle stability
eigenvalues, period, Floquet multipliers) evaluated anywhere
along its $\stab{p}$-orbit are the same. A symmetry thus
reduces the number of inequivalent solutions. So we also need
to describe the symmetry of a \emph{solution}, as opposed to
\refeq{eq:equivFinite}, the symmetry of the \emph{system}.

The \emph{\fixedsp} $\Fix{\Subgroup}$ of a subgroup
$\Subgroup\subset\Group$ is the subspace of $\pS$ containing
all fixed points of $\Subgroup$:
\[
	\Fix{\Subgroup}=
      \{\ssp\in\pS,\,\LieEl\in\Subgroup \,|\,
        \LieEl \ssp = \ssp \}
\,.
\]
The physical importance of \fixedsp s lies in the fact that
they are invariant under $\Group$-equivariant
dynamics\rf{golubitsky2002sp},
\[
 f^\tau\left(\Fix{\Subgroup}\right)\subseteq \Fix{\Subgroup}
\]
for all times $\tau$. Therefore if $\ssp(\tau)$ is a solution
of an equivariant ODE then its symmetry
$\stab{\ssp(\tau)}=\stab{\ssp(0)}$ is preserved for for all
times.

In contrast to \emph{\eqv} solutions that satisfy
$f^\tau(\ssp)  =  \ssp$, \emph{\reqva} satisfy
$f^\tau(\ssp) = \LieEl( \tau) \, \ssp$ for any $\tau$,
see \reffig{f:MeanVelocityFrame}. In
a co-moving frame moving along the group orbit
with velocity $\vel(\ssp) = \velRel \cdot \groupTan(\ssp)$,
    \ES{define $\groupTan$ in symmetry section, choose
    a prettier symbol. {\bf PC:} I see it coming; you will
    make it all look Greek to me. {\bf ES:} Well, unless
	you want to change time to $\tau$ we have to change
	group tangent. {\bf PC:} I do call time $\tau$ in
    continuous.tex .}
the \reqv\ appears as an \eqv.

A {\em \rpo}is an orbit $\pS_p$ for
which the initial point exactly recurs
    \index{periodic!orbit!relative}\index{relative!periodic orbit}
\beq
\ssp_p (0) = \LieEl_p \ssp_p (\period{p} )
    \,,\qquad
\ssp_p (\tau) \in \pS_p
    \,,
\label{RPOrelper1}
\eeq
at a fixed {\em relative period} $\period{p}$, but shifted by
a fixed group action ${\LieEl_p}$ which brings the endpoint
$\ssp_p (\period{p} ) $ back into the initial point $\ssp_p
(0) $, see \reffig{f:rpo}\,(b). The group action ${\LieEl_p}=
\LieEl_p(\gSpace)$ parameters $\gSpace_p =
(\gSpace_1,\gSpace_2,\cdots\gSpace_N)$ will be referred to as
``phases,'' or ``shifts.'' For dynamical systems with only
continuous (no discrete) symmetries, the parameters
$\{t,\gSpace_1,\cdots,\gSpace_N\}$ are real numbers, ratios
$\pi/\gSpace_j$ are almost never rational, and the likelihood
of closing into a {\po} is {zero}. Thus the trajectory
of \rpo\ generically sweeps out the group orbit ergodically.

\caption{
(a) A {\em \reqv\ orbit} starts out at some point $\ssp(0)$,
with the dynamical flow field $\vel(\ssp) = \velRel \cdot
\groupTan(\ssp)$ pointing along the group tangent space. For
the $\SOn{2}$ symmetry depicted here, the flow traces out the
group orbit of $\ssp(0)$ in time $\period{}=2\pi/\velRel$.
An
{\em \eqv} lives either in the $\Fix{\Group}$ subspace
($x_3$ axis in this sketch), or on a group orbit as the one
depicted here, but with zero angular velocity $\velRel$. In
that case the circle (in general, $N$-torus) depicts a
continuous family of fixed \eqva, related only by the group
action.
(b) A {\em \rpo} starts out at $\ssp(0)$ with the dynamical $\vel$ and
group tangent $\groupTan$ flows pointing in different
directions, and returns to the group orbit of $\ssp(0)$ after
time $\period{p}$ at $\ssp(\period{p})=\LieEl_p \ssp (0)$, a
rotation of the initial point by $\LieEl_p$.

A \emph{\rpo} is periodic in its
mean velocity $\velRel_p=\gSpace_p/\period{p}$ co-rotating
frame (see \reffig{f:MeanVelocityFrame}), but in the
stationary frame its trajectory is quasiperiodic.
A co-moving
frame is helpful in visualizing a single `relative' orbit,
but useless for viewing collections of orbits, as each one
drifts with its own angular velocity. Visualization of all
\rpo s as \po s we attain only by global\marginpar{explain global vs
local in intro. It is not really global.} symmetry reduction,
to be undertaken in the following.
