\section{\label{s:symSol} Symmetries of solutions}

The \emph{group orbit} or $\Group$-orbit of
$x\in\Rls{n}$ is the set
\beq
	\Group x = \{\LieEl x: \LieEl\in\Group\}\,
\eeq
of all points in which $x$ is mapped under the action of all
group elements of $\Group$.
A set of group actions which maps a \statesp\ point $\ssp$ into itself,
\beq
\stab{\ssp} =\{\LieEl \in \Group: \LieEl \ssp = \ssp \}
    \,,
\ee{def:isotr}
is called the \emph{isotropy} (or \emph{stabilizer})  group of $\ssp$.
The isotropy subgroup is the largest subgroup (in the
sense of set inclusion) that leaves $\ssp$ fixed.
The \emph{group of symmetries} of a set $X$ is the largest
subgroup $\Subgroup_X$ that leaves $X$ invariant as a set:
\beq
	\Group_X= {\LieEl: \LieEl X = X}\,.
\eeq

The \emph{\fixedsp} of a subgroup $\Subgroup\subset\Group$,
denoted by $\Fix{\Subgroup}$, is the subspace of $\Manif$
containing all fixed points of $\Sigma$:
\[
	\Fix{\Sigma}=\{\ssp\in\Manif\ |\ \sigma \ssp = \ssp\,,\ \forall \sigma\in\Sigma\}\,.
\]
The physical importance of \fixedsp s lies in the fact that
they are invariant under $\Group$-equivariant dynamics\rf{golubitsky2002sp},
\[
 f^t\left(\Fix{\Subgroup}\right)\subseteq \Fix{\Subgroup}
\] for all
$t$. Therefore if $\ssp(t)$ is a solution trajectory of an
equivariant ODE then $\stab{\ssp(t)}=\stab{\ssp(0)}$ for all $t$.


In contrast to \emph{\eqv} solutions that satisfy
$f^\tau(\ssp) - \ssp = 0$, \emph{\reqva} satisfy
$f^\tau(\ssp) - \LieEl( \tau) \, \ssp= 0$ for any $\tau$,
see \reffig{f:MeanVelocityFrame}. In
a co-moving frame moving along the group orbit
with velocity $\vel(\ssp) = \velRel \cdot \groupTan(\ssp)$,
    \ES{define $\groupTan$ in symmetry section, choose
    a prettier symbol. {\bf PC:} I see it coming; you will
    make it all look Greek to me. {\bf ES:} Well, unless
	you want to change time to $\tau$ we have to change
	group tangent. {\bf PC:} I do call time $\tau$ in
    continuous.tex .}
the \reqv\ appears as an \eqv.

A {\em \rpo} $p$ is an orbit $\pS_p$ 
which exactly recurs
    \index{periodic!orbit!relative}\index{relative!periodic orbit}
\beq
\ssp_p (0) = \LieEl_p \ssp_p (\period{p} )
    \,,\qquad
\ssp_p (\tau) \in \pS_p
    \,,
\label{RPOrelper1}
\eeq
at a fixed {\em relative period} $\period{p}$, but
shifted by a fixed group action ${\LieEl_p}$
which brings the endpoint $\ssp_p (\period{p} ) $
back into the initial point $\ssp_p (0) $, see \reffig{f:rpo}\,(b).
The group action ${\LieEl_p}$ parameters
$\gSpace = (\gSpace_1,\gSpace_2,\cdots\gSpace_N)$
will be referred to as ``phases,'' or ``shifts.''
% In contrast to the pre-periodic \refeq{preperiodic},
For dynamical systems with only continuous (no discrete)
symmetries, the parameters $\{t,\gSpace_1,\cdots,\gSpace_N\}$
are real numbers, ratios $\pi/\gSpace_j$ are almost never
rational, the likelihood of finding a {\po} for such system is
{zero}, and such \rpo s are almost never eventually periodic.
The phases here are irrational, and the trajectory sweeps out
ergodically the group orbit without ever closing into a \po.

\caption{
(a) A {\em \reqv\ orbit} starts out at some point $\ssp(0)$,
with the dynamical flow field $\vel(\ssp) = \velRel \cdot
\groupTan(\ssp)$ pointing along the group tangent space. For
the $\SOn{2}$ symmetry depicted here, the flow traces out the
group orbit of $\ssp(0)$ in time $\period{}=2\pi/\velRel$.
An
{\em \eqv} lives either in the $\Fix{\Group}$ subspace
($x_3$ axis in this sketch), or on a group orbit as the one
depicted here, but with zero angular velocity $\velRel$. In
that case the circle (in general, $N$-torus) depicts a
continuous family of fixed \eqva, related only by the group
action.
(b) A {\em \rpo} starts out at $\ssp(0)$ with the dynamical $\vel$ and
group tangent $\groupTan$ flows pointing in different
directions, and returns to the group orbit of $\ssp(0)$ after
time $\period{p}$ at $\ssp(\period{p})=\LieEl_p \ssp (0)$, a
rotation of the initial point by $\LieEl_p$.

A \emph{\rpo} is periodic in its
mean velocity $\velRel_p=\gSpace_p/\period{p}$ co-rotating
frame (see \reffig{f:MeanVelocityFrame}), but in the
stationary frame its trajectory is quasiperiodic.
A co-moving
frame is helpful in visualizing a single `relative' orbit,
but useless for viewing collections of orbits, as each one
drifts with its own angular velocity. Visualization of all
\rpo s as \po s we attain only by global\marginpar{explain global vs
local in intro. It is not really global.} symmetry reduction,
to be undertaken in the following.
