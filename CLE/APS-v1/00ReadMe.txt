Dear Prof. Siminos,
   How are you proceeding with your revision of "State space
geometry of a spatio-temporally chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
flow," in response to the Reviewing Editor's decision letter
of February 28, 2008? We are concerned that we have not yet
received this revision.
   Provided there are no special circumstances, we ask that you
submit your revised manuscript within a month.

NOTES
-----

John F. Gibson:

Georgia Tech does subscribe to APS. Searching 'applied
dynamical systems' on the ejournals page brings it up under
"Electronic version: EBSCOhost Academic Search Complete."

I reviewed APS and Nonlinearity submission guidelines. The
key difference is that multimedia can be an essential component
of APS papers, whereas it must be supplementary for
Nonlinearity. APS is online-only and is ok with color, and
Nonlinearity has a print version and wants all figures to be
readable in black-and-white.
