\subsection{\label{s:laserMFnum}\Poincare\ section and slice}

In this section we demonstrate in the example of \cLe\
that we can reduce continuous symmetry and construct return maps
for high-dimensional flows even through a slice that is well
defined only locally, such as coordinate slice $x_1=0$
of \refsect{sec:CLeMF}.

Transformations \refeq{eq:invLaser} obtained
through use of {\mframes} with a coordinate \slice\
are singular in subspace $x_1=x_2=0$.
Therefore we would like to ensure that we apply our
reduction procedure only on points away from this subspace. A
way to achieve this is by a judicious choice of \Poincare\
section in original space, \ie~before reduction. Since we are
ultimately interested in reducing the dynamics to a
\Poincare\ return map this suffices for our purposes.
Locating a \Poincare\ section is a non-trivial task
but as we will see in the following, for the procedure to
work we will have to reduce the candidate \Poincare\ sections
to those that are invariant (as a set) under the group
action. Here we are naturally led to choose a section that passes through
\reqv~\REQV{}{1} such as section $\mathcal{P}$
defined by $\overline{x}_2-\overline{y}_2=0$ in the variables
of \refeq{eq:invLaser} or by $x_1^2+x_2^2-(x_1 y_1 + x_2
y_2)=0$ in original space and a suitable orientation
condition so that trajectories intersect the section away
from $x_1=x_2=0$ subspace. Here the orientation condition has
be chosen so that trajectories intersect $\mathcal{P}$ moving
from the ``outside'' of the section in
\reffig{fig:CLEmartini} to the ``inside''. Since
$\mathcal{P}$ has been defined by a condition in invariant
variables \refeq{eq:invLaser} it is
$\SOn{2}$-invariant in equivariant variables. Therefore the group
orbit of any point on $\mathcal{P}$ lies on $\mathcal{P}$. In
\reffig{fig:CLEmartini} the group orbits of points of
intersection of \rpo~\cycle{01} are visualized as circles
on $\mathcal{P}$.

The next step is to choose a representative out of each group
orbit by means of a \slice\ that
intersects each group orbit exactly once. Since Poincar\'e section $\mathcal{P}$
has been chosen to lie away from $x_1=x_2=0$, even a simple
coordinate slice, such as $\mathcal{K}$ defined by $x_1=0$ is adequate.
Geometrically this is equivalent to rotating
each point of intersection on $\mathcal{K}$ by an appropriate
angle so that it lies on $\mathcal{K}$, exactly as prescribed
by the moving frame \refeq{eq:CLEmf}. As we remarked in \refsect{s:mfReqb}
this rotation, a linear operation for any given point, can be applied efficiently
even in a high dimensional space.

\CLe\ example is rather simple and this section seems to be but a pointless elaboration.
Yet for more involved symmetry groups it will be important to be able to
carry out reduction by local {\slice s}. The reason such a strategy works
is the local nature of \Poincare\ sections. The return map contains complete
information about the flow by keeping track of return to a submanifold of state space.
Different \Poincare\ sections that intersect the same orbits provide conjugate return
maps with essentially the same information. This allows great freedom to avoid group-action-induced
singularities.
