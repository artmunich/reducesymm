\CLe\ (henceforth CLE) were introduced by Gibbon and McGuinness\rf{GibMcCLE82} as a low-dimensional model
of baroclinic instability in the atmosphere.
As the name suggests they are a complex generalization
of Lorenz equations\rf{lorenz}:
\beq
\index{Complex Lorenz equations}
\begin{split}
 \dot{x} &=-\sigma x+ \sigma y \cont
 \dot{y} &=(\rLor-z)x-a y \cont
 \dot{z} &= \frac{1}{2}\left(x y^*+x^*y\right)-b z\,,
 \label{eq:CLe}
\end{split}
\eeq
where $x,y$ are complex variables, $z$ is real, while the
parameters $\sigma,\,b$ are real and $\rLor=\RerCLor+i
\ImrCLor$, $a=1-i e$ are complex.

It can easily be checked that \cLe\ are 
equivariant under the one parameter rotation
group $\Un{1}\cong\SOn{2}$ acting by
\beq\label{eq:SO2cle}
	(x,\,y,\,z)\mapsto (e^{i\theta}x,\,e^{i\theta}y,\,z)\,,\ \theta\in[0,2\pi]\,.
\eeq

\CLe\ with $\ImrCLor=0$ and $e \neq 0$ also appear as a truncation 
of Maxwell-Bloch equations describing a single
mode, detuned, ring laser in Bakasov and Abraham\rf{BakasovAbraham93}, with $e$ proportional to detuning. 
For simplicity and without any sacrificing any symmetry properties we follow the choice $\ImrCLor=0$
in all numerical results that follow. We also set the parameters to the Lorenz values
$\RerCLor=28,\, b=8/3,\, \sigma=10$, with the ``detuning'' $e=1/10$.

In the case of {\cLe}  the origin \EQV{0} is an \eqv\ of
\refeq{eq:CLe} for any value of the parameters. As shown in
\refref{FowlerCLE82} it is stable for $0<\RerCLor<\rho_{1c}$
and unstable for $\rho_{1c}<\RerCLor$, where
\beq
	\rho_{1c} = 1 + \frac{(e+\ImrCLor)(e-\sigma \ImrCLor)}{(\sigma+1)^2}\,.
\eeq
At bifurcation a pair of eigenvalues crosses the imaginary axis with imaginary part:
\beq
	\omega_c = \frac{\sigma (e + \ImrCLor)}{\sigma+1}\,.
	\label{eq:omegaCLE}
\eeq
and a \emph{relative equilibrium} \REQV{}{1} is born. For $e+\ImrCLor=0$ the
relative equilibrium degenerates to an \SOn{2}-orbit of
\eqva\rf{FowlerCLE82}, since $\omega_c =0$. Ning and Haken\rf{NingHakenCLE90}
and Zeghlache and Mandel\rf{ZeMa85} use equations isomorphic to \cLe\ with 
$e+\ImrCLor=0$ in their studies of detuned ring lasers.  
From a symmetry perspective existense of a \reqv\ in a system with \SOn{2}
symmetry is the generic situation, so
here we will stick to the choice $\ImrCLor=0$ and $e \neq 0$ of Bakasov and 
Abraham\rf{BakasovAbraham93}.

As $\RerCLor$ is increased,  a secondary bifurcation from \REQV{}{1} 
is expected, according to Krupa's
theorem\rf{Krupa90}, to result in \emph{relative periodic
orbits} that satisfy
\beq
	\Rot{\theta_p}x(t+T_p)=x(t)\,.
\eeq
A {\rpo} of {\cLe} is shown in \reffig{fig:CLE} as its iterations fill
a torus. Therefore we see that in a system with a $1$-dimensional
continuous symmetry we have to account for circles (\reqva) instead of points (\eqva)
and tori (\rpo s) instead of curves (\po s) as the organizational blocks of the attractor.
To understand the geometry of the system one can choose to look at tori or realize
that along the direction of rotations a tori does not change and pursue symmetry
reduction.


\PublicPrivate{}{
The implications  of this fact are illustrated in
\reffig{fig:CLE}, where we project trajectories in
$(x_1,x_2,z)$ axes, where $x=x_1+ i\, x_2\,,\ y=y_1+i\, x_2$
with $x_i,\,y_i\in\Rls{}$. A generic trajectory slowly ``drifts''
along the direction of rotations while tracing a Lorenz-butterfly
like attractor.



 \refFig{fig:CLE} illustrates the need
 to project dynamics on \reducedsp: Dynamics is organized by
 the interplay of the stable and unstable manifolds of \eqv\
 \EQV{0} and \reqv\ \REQV{}{1} but the dynamics along the
 direction of rotation blur the picture and the notion of
 recurrence becomes relative. We will present various
 approaches to orbit space reduction in the following.

To find the location of the \reqv\ it is convenient to work
on polar coordinates defined by $x=r_1 e^{i \phi_1},\,y=r_2
e^{i \phi_2}$. Equations \refeq{eq:CLe} take the form
    %PC: Rebecca and I rederived these: they check.
\beq
\begin{split}
	\dot{r}_1 &=-\sigma (r_1 - r_2\cos\phi) \cont
	\dot{r}_2 &=-r_2 + r_1(\RerCLor -z)(\cos\phi-\ImrCLor\sin\phi) \cont
	\dot{z} &=  -b z+r_1 r_2\cos\phi \cont	
	\dot{\phi} &=-e-\frac{\sigma r_2 \sin\phi}{r_1}-\frac{r_1(\RerCLor-z) (\ImrCLor\cos\phi+\sin\phi) }{r_2}\,,
	\label{eq:CLePolar}
\end{split}
\eeq
where $\phi=\phi_1-\phi_2$ and the evolution equations for
$\phi_1,\phi_2$ are given by
\beq
\begin{split}
	\dot{\phi}_1 &=-\frac{\sigma r_2 \sin\phi}{r_1}\cont
	\dot{\phi_2} &= e +\frac{r_1\left( (\RerCLor -z)\sin\phi+\ImrCLor\cos\phi\right)}{r_2}\,.
	\label{eq:CLeAngl}
\end{split}
\eeq

For simplicity we now turn to the ``laser case''
$e\neq0,\;\ImrCLor=0$. The condition for a \reqv\ is that all 
time derivatives in \refeq{eq:CLePolar}, while $\dot{\phi}_1=\dot{\phi}_2\neq 0$.
If $\dot{\phi}_1=\dot{\phi}_2=0$ we would have (a group orbit of) equilibria. We get
% Explicit form here, simplified in terms of z component below
% \beq
% \begin{split}
% 	z &= -\frac{e^2}{(\sigma +1)^2}+\RerCLor -1\cont
% 	r_2 &= \frac{\sqrt{-b \left(e^2+(\sigma +1)^2\right)\left(e^2-(\RerCLor -1) (\sigma +1)^2\right)}}{(\sigma+1)^2}\cont
% 	r_1 &= \frac{\sqrt{-b \left(e^2-(\RerCLor -1) (\sigma +1)^2\right)}}{\sigma +1}\cont
% 	\Phi &= -\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sigma +1}{\sqrt{e^2+(\sigma +1)^2}}\right)
% \end{split}
% \eeq
\beq
\begin{split}
	z^{(1)} &= \frac{-e^2+(\RerCLor -1)(\sigma +1)^2}{(\sigma +1)^2}\cont
	r_1^{(1)} &= \sqrt{b z^{(1)}}\cont
	r_2^{(1)} &= \sqrt{b \left(e^2+(\sigma +1)^2\right)z^{(1)}}\cont
	\phi^{(1)} &= -\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sigma +1}{\sqrt{e^2+(\sigma +1)^2}}\right)\,.
\end{split}
\eeq
Substituting in \refeq{eq:CLeAngl} we get $\dot{\phi}_1=\dot{\phi}_2=e \sigma/(1 + \sigma)\neq 0$ for $e\neq0$
and thus we have indeed a \reqv, not a group orbit of \eqva.

Calculation  in polar coordinates $r_1,r_2,\phi,z$ of stability eigenvalues for \REQV{}{1}
for the set of parameters we use here yields
\beq
	\eigRe[1]\pm i\eigIm[1]= 0.0938\pm 10.1945i,\,
    \eigExp[3]=-11.0009,\, \eigExp[4]= -13.8534\,.
	\label{eq:CLeREQBstab}
\eeq

In \ref{s:StabReq} we show how to calculate stability of \reqva\ in \emph{equivariant} 
variables without change of coordinates to polar or any other set of symmetry invariant variables.
