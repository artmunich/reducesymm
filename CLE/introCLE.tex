Why worry about continuous symmetries? Here is a rather
simple, 5-dimensional example of the effect a continuous
symmetry has on dynamics. Consider a complex generalization
of Lorenz equations,
\bea
 \dot{x} &=& -\sigma x+ \sigma y \,,\qquad
 \dot{y} \,=\, (\rLor-z)x-a y \continue
 \dot{z} &=& (x y^*+x^*y)/2 -b z\,,
 \label{eq:CLe}
\eea
where $x,y$ are complex variables, $z$ is real, while the
parameters $\sigma,\,b$ are real and $\rLor=\RerCLor+i
\ImrCLor$, $a=1-i e$ are complex. Recast in real variables,
this is a set of five coupled ODEs
\bea
	\dot{x}_1 &=& -\sigma x_1 + \sigma y_1\continue
	\dot{x}_2 &=& -\sigma x_2 + \sigma y_2\continue
	\dot{y}_1 &=& (\RerCLor-z) x_1 - \ImrCLor x_2 -y_1-e y_2 \continue
	\dot{y}_2 &=& \ImrCLor x_1 + (\RerCLor-z) x_2 + e y_1- y_2\continue
	\dot{z} \; &=& -b z + x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2
    \,.
\label{eq:CLeR}
\eea
In all numerical examples that follow, the parameters will be
set to $\RerCLor=28,\, \ImrCLor=0,\, b=8/3,\, \sigma=10,\, e=
1/10$, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
\refFig{fig:CLE} offers a visualization of typical long-time
dynamics of the \CLf. It is a mess.
    \PC{I would prefer to have a plot of long-time trajectory
        without exact solutions superimposed, as in ChaosBook
    refFig\,\{fig:CLEx1x2z\}.
    }

\CLe\ \refeq{eq:CLe} were introduced by Gibbon and
McGuinness\rf{GibMcCLE82,FowlerCLE82} as a
low-dim\-ens\-ion\-al model of baroclinic instability in the
atmosphere. Ning and Haken\rf{NingHakenCLE90} have shown that
equations isomorphic to \cLe\ also appear as a truncation of
Maxwell-Bloch equations describing a single mode, detuned,
ring laser. They set $e+\ImrCLor=0$ so that a detuned \eqv\
exists. Bakasov and Abraham\rf{BakasovAbraham93} show that
this choice is `degenerate' (the choice of Ning and Haken
leads to non-generic bifurcations) and show that one can use
\cLe\ with $\ImrCLor=0$ and $e \neq 0$ to describe detuned
lasers.

\CLe\ are a dynamical system with a continuous (but no
discrete) symmetry, equivariant under the one-parameter
rotation group $\Un{1}\cong\SOn{2}$ acting by
\beq\label{eq:SO2cle}
	(x,\,y,\,z)\mapsto (
    e^{i\theta}x,\,e^{i\theta}y,\,z)\,,\ \theta\in[0,2\pi]\,.
\eeq
Here we are not interested in the physical
applications of these equations; rather, we study them as a
simple example of a dynamical system with continuous (but no
discrete) symmetries, with a view of testing methods of
reducing the dynamics to a lower-dimensional \reducedsp.
    \PC{looks like one should also read \refref{Abraham95}; they
    report on various return maps}
We investigate
various ways of `quotienting' its \SOn{2} symmetry, and
reducing the dynamics to a 4-dim\-ens\-ion\-al \reducedsp. As
we shall show, the dynamics has a nice {\stretchf}
action, but that is totally masked by the continuous symmetry
drifts. We shall not rest until we attain the simplicity of
\reffig{fig:PCunrot32}, and the bliss of 1-dim\-ens\-ion\-al
return map of \reffig{fig:CLEipRM}.
