In this section we present the {\mframes}, introduced by G. Darboux and 
systematized by \'E. Cartan\rf{CartanMF}. 
Fels and Olver\rf{FelsOlver98,FelsOlver99} reformulated the method so that a
moving frame is simply an equivariant mapping from the space on which a
group acts to the group parameter. The utility of a moving frame is
that it can be used to generate functionally independent invariant coordinates 
for the action of a group $\Group$ on a manifold $\Manif$ under 
very general assumptions. Here we will describe how, and to what extend, 
the invariants thus generated can be utilized for
symmetry reduction in high-dimensional flows. In \refsect{s:mfReqb} we will
exploit the geometric interpretation of moving frames for a more direct and
efficient approach to symmetry reduction. We refer the reader to \refrefs{FelsOlver98,FelsOlver99} 
for proof of results reviewed here and to \refref{OlverInv}
for a pedagogical exposition.

In the following let $\Group$ be $N$-dimensional and act on a
$d$-dimensional manifold $\Manif$. A moving frame is a smooth
$\Group$-equivariant mapping $\rho$ from $\Manif$ to the
$\Group$, that is to the group parameters. \ES{perharps not
needed: One distinguishes between left moving frames for which
the equivariance condition is $\rho(\LieEl x)=\LieEl\rho(x)\,,\
x\in\Manif\,,\ \LieEl\in\Group$ and right moving frames for
which the equivariance condition is $\rho(\LieEl
x)=\rho(x)\LieEl^{-1}\,,\ x\in\Manif\,,\ \LieEl\in\Group$. }
\ES{rephrased proposition: As shown in \refref{FelsOlver99} a moving frame exists
in a neighborhood of a point $x\in\Manif$ if and only if
$\Group$ acts freely and regularly near x.} For the practical
construction of a moving frame for an $N-$dimensional Lie group
$\Group$ we will need to define a slice, introduced in \refsect{s:symDyn}.
Therefore the existense of a moving frame depends on 
group orbits having the same dimension.

To construct a moving frame, let $K\subset\Manif$ be a {\csection}. For $x\in \Manif$, let
$\LieEl=\rho(x)$ be the unique group element that maps $x$
to the {\csection}: $g x = \rho(x) x\, \in K$. Then
$\rho:\Manif\rightarrow \Group$ is a right moving frame\rf{FelsOlver98}.

A {\csection} $K$ can be defined by means of level sets of
functions $K_i(x)=c_i$, where $x\in V$ and $i=1,\ldots,r$. If
the $K_i(x)$ coincide with the local coordinates $x_i$ on the
manifold $V$, \ie~$K_i(x)=x_i$, then we call $K$ a
\emph{coordinate \csection}.


Once a coordinate cross-section  
$K=\{x_1=c_1,\ldots,x_r=c_r\}$ is defined by the first $r$
coordinates (relabel coordinates as necessary),
we write the group transformations as
\beq
	\overline{x}= g \cdot x = w(g,x)\,.
	\label{eq:transNorm}
\eeq
Equating the first $r$ components of the function $w$ to the
constants in the definition of the {\csection} $K_i(x)=c_i$
yields the \emph{normalization equations} for $K$:
\beq
	\overline{x}_1=w_1(g,x)=c_1,\ldots,\overline{x}_r=w_r(g,x)=c_r\,.
	\label{eq:normalization}
\eeq
The normalization equations \refeq{eq:normalization}
can always be solved\rf{FelsOlver99} for the group parameters in terms of
$x$, yielding the moving frame associated with $K$:
$\LieEl=\LieEl(x)$. Substitution of the moving frame equation back
in \refeq{eq:transNorm} will yield the $n-r$
\emph{fundamental invariants}, that is functionally independent
invariants that can be used as a basis in which any other invariant
can be expressed. Thus the fundamental invariants serve to distinguish
group orbits in the neighborhood of the {\csection}, \ie~two points
lie on the same group orbit if and only if all fundamental invariants 
agree. For proof \cf~\refrefs{FelsOlver98,FelsOlver99}.

Invariants generated by \mframes\ can be used in the same manner as a Hilbert
polynomial basis for symmetry reduction, by projecting $d$-dimensional trajectories
to $(d-N)$-dimensional variables. The fact that a moving frame exists
only where group orbits have the same dimension is not as severe a restriction
as it might seem. This condition fails on a \fixedsp\ of a continuous subgroup
of \Group\ but, as we have seen in \refsect{s:symDyn}, {\fixedsp s} are flow-invariant.
Therefore, one can always hope to cover the reduced space with properly chosen {\csection s}.
Nevertheless, as we will see in next section, coordinate {\csection s} are not an optimal
choice for common actions of \SOn{2} on truncations of PDEs, such as in the \cLe\ example.

In this section we illustrate symmetry reduction through
the use of invariants computed
with the moving frame method in the example of \cLe.
The $z$-axis is the \fixedsp\ of \SOn{2} acting by 
\refeq{eq:SO2act} on \Rls{5}. Therefore we can define
a coordinate {\csection} on $\Rls{5}\backslash\{x_1=x_2=y_1=y_2=0\}$ 
by, for instance,
\beq\label{eq:CLEsliceSO2}
x_1=0,\,x_2>0\,.
\eeq
We can now construct a moving frame for the action
\refeq{eq:SO2act} of $\SOn{2}$ as follows. We write out
explicitly the group transformations:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:CLEnorm}
\begin{align}
 	\overline{x}_1 &= x_1 \cos\theta - x_2 \sin\theta\label{eq:CLEexplSO2a}\cont
	\overline{x}_2 &= x_1 \sin\theta + x_2 \cos\theta\label{eq:CLEexplSO2b}\cont
	\overline{y}_1 &= y_1 \cos\theta - y_2 \sin\theta\label{eq:CLEexplSO2c}\cont
	\overline{y}_2 &= y_1 \sin\theta + y_2 \cos\theta\label{eq:CLEexplSO2d}\cont	
	\overline{z} &= z\,.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
We set $\overline{x}_1=0$ and solve
\refeq{eq:CLEexplSO2a} for the group parameter to obtain the moving frame
\beq
	\theta=\tan^{-1}\frac{x_1}{x_2}
	\label{eq:CLEmf}
\eeq
which brings any point  back to the {\csection}.
Here it is important that
$\tan^{-1}$ distinguishes quadrants in the $(x_1,x_2)$ plane to ensure that the
transformation results in the correct geometric
interpretation, \ie\ to ensure $x_2>0$.
Substituting \refeq{eq:CLEmf} in the remaining equations \refeq{eq:CLEnorm} we
get the invariants
\beq
\begin{split}
	\overline{x}_2 &= \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2} = r_1 \cont
	\overline{y}_1 &= {(x_2 y_1-x_1 y_2)}/{r_1}\cont
	\overline{y}_2 &= {(x_1 y_1+x_2 y_2)}/{r_1}\cont	
	\overline{z} &= z\,.
	\label{eq:invLaser}
\end{split}
\eeq
    \ES{The solution $\theta = 2
    \tan^{-1}\frac{-x_2+\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}}{x_1}$ was
    returned by Mathematica. If we use $\theta =
    \tan^{-1}\frac{x_2}{x_1}$ without taking care of the
    quadrant our results are multiplied by $sgn(x_2)$.}
Note the relation to the invariant polynomials
\refeq{eq:ipLaser} and also that no syzygy is present.

On the other hand observe that the invariants are not well defined
in the limit of $x=x_1+i x_2$ approaching zero.
Using $x=r_1\, e^{i\phi_1}\,,\, y=r_2\, e^{i\phi_2}$ we can write
\ES{dropped: for instance, $x_2 y_1-x_1 y_2 = r_1 r_2 \sin(\phi_1-\phi_2)$
and thus}
\beq
  \begin{split}
	  \overline{x}_2 &= r_1 \cont
	  \overline{y}_1 &= r_2\sin(\phi_1-\phi_2)\cont
	  \overline{y}_2 &= r_2\cos(\phi_1-\phi_2)\cont	
	  \overline{z} &= z\,.
	  \label{eq:invLaserPolar}
  \end{split}
\eeq
Therefore, for any given $y$ (therefore also for given $\phi_2$), 
the limit of $\overline{y}$ for $x \rightarrow 0$
does not exist, as the above expression depends on the direction
on the complex $x$-plane along which we approach zero.
\ES{does not belong here:
In terms of projecting dynamics
on variables \refeq{eq:invLaser} (or applying the equivalent
procedure of rotating points back to the \slice) this means that
we need to take into account the direction along which
we approach zero and use the `angle
of descent' as the angle with which we rotate points back to the \slice, if such
points have exactly $x=0$.
	}
Note that the invariants are not defined on
the subspace $U_S$ defined by $x_1=x_2=0$ even though the
group action is non-regular only in a subset of $U_S$, the
$z$-axis $x_1=x_2=y_1=y_2=0$ which is the \fixedsp\ of \SOn{2}.
In the spirit of \refref{GL-Gil07b} the transformations \refeq{eq:invLaser}
can therefore be characterized as non-optimal, in the sense
that we have singularity in a proper superset of $\Fix{\SOn{2}}$.
The reason the transformations fail on $U_S$ and not only on the $z$-axis
can be traced back to the way we construct the moving frame. The action
of the group can be thought of as a direct sum of irreducible
actions and the corresponding invariant (irreducible)
subspaces are the $(x_1,\,x_2)$ and $(y_1,\,y_2)$
planes.
%PC OK \ES{Not sure if planes is acceptable term here.}.
Since irreducible subspaces are by definition group-invariant
implies that we could define a moving frame in any one of them 
independently. The singular subspace would then be determined
by the fixed points of group action in this subspace alone. 
For instance, by choosing an angle in the $(x_1,\,x_2)$ irreducible subspace
as the moving frame map, the singular set is the point
$x_1=x_2=0$ in this irreducible subspace. Going back to the full
$5$-dimensional space the singular set of the transformations
is still given by $x_1=x_2=0$.
%}

While a singularity in $\Fix{\SOn{2}}$ cannot be reached by generic orbits
as {\fixedsp s} are flow invariant, the same is not true for {\fixedsp s}
of irreducible representations of the group action\ES{make sure!!!}. 
The fact that trajectories of \cLf\ in \reffig{fig:CLEmf} stay away from $r_1=0$ is therefore
fortuitous. 

It is instructive to write \cLe~\refeq{eq:CLe} in the
variables \refeq{eq:invLaser}. This is achieved by using the
chain rule \refeq{ChainRul} and expressing the result in
terms of variables \refeq{eq:invLaser}. The equations now
read
\beq
\begin{split}
\dot{\overline{x}}_1 &= 0\,\\
\dot{\overline{x}}_2 &=-\sigma  \left(\overline{x}_2-\overline{y}_2 \right)\,,\\
\dot{\overline{y}}_1 &=-\overline{y}_1- \left(e+\sigma\frac{\overline{y}_1}{\overline{x}_2} \right)\overline{y}_2\,,\\
\dot{\overline{y}}_2 &=(\RerCLor -z)\overline{x}_2+\left(e+\frac{\sigma  \overline{y}_1}{\overline{x}_2}
\right) \overline{y}_1-\overline{y}_2\,,\\
\dot{z} &=\overline{x}_2 \overline{y}_2-b z\,.
\end{split}
\eeq
We again observe the singularity as
$\overline{x}_2=r_1\rightarrow 0$.

The projections in \reffig{fig:CLEmf} reveal more about the
topology of the attractor but also present large ``jumps."
Note that the invariants \refeq{eq:invLaser} are related to
the invariant polynomials \refeq{eq:ipLaser} by division by
$\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}$. This is the reason we get a clearer
visualization of the dynamics: All invariants scale
dimensionally as the original coordinates. At the same time
division by $\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}$ causes the jumps in the
$\overline{y}$ components whenever the magnitude of $x$ comes
close to zero.

\PublicPrivate{}{
\ES{I think I might drop this part of the section, as it is a simple but
ad-hoc  modification. I will have to make sure that return map
figures are not completely elliminated from this section though.}
Geometrically we can interpret the jumps in the
$\overline{y}$ coordinates as follows: We have chosen to
measure angle on one of the irreducible subspaces of \SOn{2},
the $x$-plane, and project the dynamics on orbit space by
counter-rotating in both irreducible subspaces (the $x$- and
$y$-plane.) As long as a trajectory traces one lobe of the
Lorenz attractor the angle varies slowly and no problem
occurs. When a trajectory changes quadrant in the $x$-plane
to visit the almost opposite lobe (due to detuning we do not
visit the lobe related by rotation by $\pi$, in reality no
such thing exists) we get a rapid change in angle as the
trajectory passes close to the origin. In the $y$-plane we do
not necessarily change quadrant. Call $\Delta \theta_x$ and
$\Delta\theta_y$ the change in angle in the $x$- and
$y$-plane respectively, when the trajectory changes quadrant
in the $x$ plane. We always reduce to \reducedsp\ by
correcting by $-\Delta\theta_x$ instead of correcting by the
smallest angle.

% Since $x$ cannot vanish
% The problem is mostly aesthetical in the present case,
% but for \KS\ system it will be important to prevent
% the denominator from vanishing.
%     \ES{Here I have a hunch that the denominator cannot
%     vanish but I can't prove it}
\PublicPrivate{}{
We observe that dynamics cannot enter $\Fix{\SOn{2}}$, \ie\
the $z$-axis, since {\fixedsp s} are flow invariant. Since
\SOn{2} representation in the \cLe\ example is a direct sum
of irreducible representations we cannot take more than one
irreducible subspace into account when setting up the
normalization equations, at least not in a convenient way. We
can however restore democracy between modes and extend
validity of the transformations to any point where the group
acts freely, by modifying the invariants as follows:
\beq
\begin{split}
	\overline{x}_2 &= (x_1^2+x_2^2)/r \cont
	\overline{y}_1 &= -(x_2 y_1-x_1 y_2)/r\cont
	\overline{y}_2 &=(x_1 y_1+x_2 y_2)/r\cont
	\overline{z} &=z\cont
	r &= \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+y_1^2+y_2^2}
    \,.
	\label{eq:invLaser2}
\end{split}
\eeq
This set of invariants lacks a geometric interpretation\ES{or
does it?} but results in much cleaner phase portraits, \cf
\reffig{fig:CLEinv}.
