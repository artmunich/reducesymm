	\dot{x}_1 &= -\sigma x_1 + \sigma y_1\cont

 \refFig{fig:CLE} illustrates the need

 the interplay of the stable and unstable manifolds of \eqv\

 approaches to orbit space reduction in the following.

To find the location of the \reqv\ it is convenient to work
on polar coordinates defined by $x=r_1 e^{i \phi_1},\,y=r_2
e^{i \phi_2}$. Equations \refeq{eq:CLe} with $\ImrCLor=0$
take the form

    Replaced $\Phi$ by $\phi$ - looks prettier to me.}
\beq
\begin{split}
	\dot{r}_1 &=-\sigma (r_1 - r_2\cos\phi) \cont
	\dot{r}_2 &=-r_2 + r_1(\RerCLor -z)\cos\phi \cont
	\dot{z} &=  -b z+r_1 r_2\cos\phi \cont	
	\dot{\phi} &=-e-\frac{\sigma r_2 \sin\phi}{r_1}-\frac{r_1(\RerCLor-z) \sin\phi }{r_2}\,,
	\label{eq:CLePolar}
\end{split}
\eeq
where $\phi=\phi_1-\phi_2$ and the evolution equations for
$\phi_1,\phi_2$ are given by
\beq
\begin{split}
	\dot{\phi}_1 &=-\frac{\sigma r_2 \sin\phi}{r_1}\cont
	\dot{\phi_2} &= e +\frac{r_1 (\RerCLor -z)\sin\phi}{r_2}\,.
	\label{eq:CLeAngl}
\end{split}
\eeq
The condition for a \reqv~ is that all time derivatives in
\refeq{eq:CLePolar} vanish from which we get
% Explicit form here, simplified in terms of z component below
% \beq
% \begin{split}
% 	z &= -\frac{e^2}{(\sigma +1)^2}+\RerCLor -1\cont
% 	r_2 &= \frac{\sqrt{-b \left(e^2+(\sigma +1)^2\right)\left(e^2-(\RerCLor -1) (\sigma +1)^2\right)}}{(\sigma+1)^2}\cont
% 	r_1 &= \frac{\sqrt{-b \left(e^2-(\RerCLor -1) (\sigma +1)^2\right)}}{\sigma +1}\cont
% 	\Phi &= -\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sigma +1}{\sqrt{e^2+(\sigma +1)^2}}\right)
% \end{split}
% \eeq
\beq
\begin{split}
	z^{(1)} &= \frac{-e^2+(\RerCLor -1)(\sigma +1)^2}{(\sigma +1)^2}\cont
	r_1^{(1)} &= \sqrt{b z^{(1)}}\cont
	r_2^{(1)} &= \sqrt{b \left(e^2+(\sigma +1)^2\right)z^{(1)}}\cont
	\phi^{(1)} &= -\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sigma +1}{\sqrt{e^2+(\sigma +1)^2}}\right)
\end{split}
\eeq
Substituting in \refeq{eq:CLeAngl} we get $\dot{\phi}_1=\dot{\phi}_2=e \sigma/(1 + \sigma)\neq 0$ for $e\neq0$
and thus we have indeed a \reqv, not a group orbit of \eqva.

Calculation  in polar coordinates $r_1,r_2,\phi,z$ of stability eigenvalues for \REQV{}{1}
for the set of parameters we use here yields
\beq
	\eigRe[1]\pm i\eigIm[1]= 0.0938\pm 10.1945i,\,
    \eigExp[3]=-11.0009,\, \eigExp[4]= -13.8534\,.

\eeq


\subsubsection{A geometric approach}
\label{laserMFnum}

Even though the computation of invariants with the method of
the moving frames is efficient, it is still computationally
prohibitive for very high dimensional flows. We will
demonstrate in the example of \CLe\ how one can use the
geometric interpretation of the moving coframe method along
with the restriction of the dynamics to a \Poincare\ section
to simply and effectively perform continuous symmetry
reduction in high-dimensional flows.

We have noted that \SOn{2} acts regularly and freely on
$X^*=\Rls{5}\backslash\{x_1=x_2=y_1=y_2=0\}$ and thus we are
guaranteed to find the fundamental invariants by the method
of moving frames if we restrict attention to $X^*$.
Nevertheless the transformations \refeq{eq:invLaser} obtained
by the moving frame method are singular in the subspace
$x_1=x_2=0$.
    \ES{Kevin Mitchell claims that what we do here is
    geometrically impossible because there is a non-removable
    singularity isomorphic to the magnetic monopole string
    singularity. In this section I argue that we do not do it
    globally and this is why it is possible (and we just do
    it!)}
Therefore we would like to ensure that we apply our
reduction procedure only on points away from this subspace. A
way to achieve this is by a judicious choice of \Poincare\
section in original space, \ie~before reduction. Since we are
ultimately interested in reducing the dynamics to a
\Poincare\ return map this suffices for our purposes.
Locating a \Poincare\ section is a non-trivial task
but as we will see in the following, for the procedure to
work we will have to reduce the candidate \Poincare\ sections
to those that are invariant (as a set) under the group
action. Furthermore we already have gained the insight from
the simpler \Le\ problem that a good choice of section is one
that passes through the \eqva\ that organize the flow. Here
we are naturally led to choose a section that passes through
the \reqv~\REQV{}{1} such as the section $\mathcal{P}$
defined by $\overline{x}_2-\overline{y}_2=0$ in the variables
of \refeq{eq:invLaser} or by $x_1^2+x_2^2-(x_1 y_1 + x_2
y_2)=0$ in original space and a suitable orientation
condition so that trajectories intersect the section away
from $x_1=x_2=0$ subspace. Here the orientation condition has
be chosen so that trajectories intersect $\mathcal{P}$ moving
from the ``outside'' of the section in
\reffig{fig:CLEmartini} to the ``inside''. Since
$\mathcal{P}$ has been defined by a condition in invariant
variables \refeq{eq:invLaser} it turns out to be
$\SOn{2}$-invariant in the full space. Therefore the group
orbit of any point on $\mathcal{P}$ lies on $\mathcal{P}$. In
\reffig{fig:CLEmartini} the group orbits of the points of
intersection of \rpo~\cycle{01} are visualized as circles
on $\mathcal{P}$.

The next step is to choose a representative out of each group
orbit by means of a slice. $\mathcal{K}$ that
intersects each group orbit exactly once. The existence of a
section is guaranteed since a {\csection} as in
\refPro{pro:crossExists} exists, this was the whole point of
restricting the problem to a Poincar\'e section on which the
group \emph{acts} freely. Here we choose $x_1=0$ for
$\mathcal{K}$. Geometrically this is equivalent to rotating
each point of intersection on $\mathcal{K}$ by an appropriate
angle so that it lies on $\mathcal{K}$, exactly as prescribed
by the moving frame \refeq{eq:CLEmf}. This rotation, a linear
operation for any given point, can be applied efficiently
even in high dimensional space when the rotation group
representation is a direct sum of irreducible
representations, as is frequently the case with truncations
of PDEs. Of course, the transformation is still non-linear
through the dependence on the angle and equivalent to the
explicit transformations \refeq{eq:invLaser}.

Implementing symmetry reduction in any of the above ways, the
reward is the same: The dynamics are reduced to a return map
to the Poincar\'e section, which due to the very strong
contraction is approximately $1$-dimensional. The dynamics on
the Poincar\'e section are parametrized by the Euclidean
distance of points along the unstable manifold, as we did for
the Lorenz example. The return map is unimodal and allows for
systematic determination of all cycles of a given length.
Here we were able to determine all cycles up to length $7$,
using the return map of \reffig{fig:CLEinvRM} to generate
guesses, and the multiple-shooting algorithm
    \PC{no such: ``
 of \refsect{sec:symShoot}
    ''}
to refine them to machine accuracy.

\subsection{Stability of \reqva}
\label{s:StabReq}

\ESedit{
In the moving frame method the reduced \statesp\ is
identified (at least locally) with the {\csection}
$\mathcal{K}$. This provides a means of calculating stability
of \reqva in reduced \statesp. Assume that, as was the case
for \CLe, the {\csection} is orthogonal to the group action
for any $x$ on $\mathcal{K}$. We observe that for the point
$x_o$ on \reqv\ \REQV{}{1} that lies on the {\csection}
$\mathcal{K}$ we can decompose $\vf(x)$ in \refeq{eq:difeq}
in a part $\vf_\shortparallel$ parallel to the group action
and a part $\vf_\perp$ on the {\csection}.
    \PC{no such: ``
, as in \refeq{flowSplit}.
    ``}
To compute stability eigenvalues of \reqv\
we only need to consider the linearization of $\vf_\perp$
which is identified with $\vf$ in reduced space. It is
convenient to introduce the projection operator
\refeq{transvProj} that projects a vector to the {\csection}.
The {\stabmat} $M_{ij}$ is then given by
    \PC{Here the projection operator \refeq{transvProj} is OK,
    as the action of the group on $\ssp_{\REQV{}{1}}$ is trivial?
    Not sure...
    }
    \PC{do not like that we changed notation
    % \refeq{stabMat}
    from $\Mvar$ to $M$ -
    should use the same notation for all reduced \statesp\ quantities,
    for example $\hat{\Mvar}$.
    }
 \beq
	M_{ij} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}(\PperpOp \cdot  \vf)_i
		= \Pperp_{ik}\frac{\partial  \vf_k}{\partial x_j}
          +\frac{\partial \Pperp_{ik}}{\partial x_j} \vf_k
		\label{eq:stabreqvdef}
 \eeq
Now
\beq
	\Pperp_{ik}	= \delta_{ik}-\frac{(\Lg \cdot x)_i(\Lg \cdot x)_k}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}
			= \delta_{ik}-\frac{\Lg_{im} x_m \Lg_{k\ell} x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}
\eeq
and
\bea
	\frac{\partial \Pperp_{in}}{\partial x_j}  &=&  -\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left(\frac{\Lg_{iq} \cdot x_q \Lg_{n\ell} \cdot x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\right)\continue
			&=& -\left(\frac{\Lg_{iq}\delta_{jq} \Lg_{n\ell}x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}+\frac{\Lg_{iq}x_q \Lg_{n\ell}\delta_{j\ell}}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}-\frac{\Lg_{iq}x_q \Lg_{n\ell}x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^4}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}(\Lg \cdot x)^2 \right)\continue
			&=& -\left(\frac{\Lg_{ij} \Lg_{n\ell}x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}+\frac{\Lg_{iq}x_q \Lg_{nj}}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}-2\frac{\Lg_{iq}x_q \Lg_{n\ell} x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^4}\Lg_{mj}\Lg_{mp}x_p \right)\continue
% 			&=& -\frac{1}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\left(\Lg_{ij}\Lg_{n\ell}x_\ell+\Lg_{iq}x_q \Lg_{nj}-2\frac{\Lg_{iq}x_q \Lg_{n\ell} x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\Lg_{mj}\Lg_{mp}x_p \right)\continue
			&=& -\frac{1}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\left(\Lg_{n\ell}x_\ell\left(\Lg_{ij}-\frac{\Lg_{iq}x_q }{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\Lg_{mj}\Lg_{mp}x_p\right)+\Lg_{iq}x_q\left( \Lg_{nj}-\frac{ \Lg_{n\ell} x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\Lg_{mj}\Lg_{mp}x_p\right) \right)\continue
			&=& -\frac{1}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\left(\Lg_{n\ell}x_\ell\left(\delta_{im}-\frac{\Lg_{iq}x_q }{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\Lg_{mp}x_p\right)\Lg_{mj}+\Lg_{iq}x_q\left( \delta_{nm}-\frac{ \Lg_{n\ell} x_\ell}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\Lg_{mp}x_p\right)\Lg_{mj} \right)\continue
			&=& -\frac{1}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\left(\Lg_{n\ell}x_\ell \Pperp_{im} \Lg_{mj}+\Lg_{iq}x_q \Pperp_{nm} \Lg_{mj} \right)\continue
\eea

Therefore \refeq{eq:stabreqvdef} takes the form
\beq
	M_{ij}=\Pperp_{in}\frac{\partial  \vf_n}{\partial x_j}-\frac{1}{(\Lg \cdot x)^2}\left(\Lg_{n\ell}x_\ell \Pperp_{im} \Lg_{mj}+\Lg_{iq}x_q \Pperp_{nm} \Lg_{mj} \right)\vf_n
\eeq
or in matrix form
\beq
	\mathbf{M}=\PperpOp \mathbf{A}-\frac{1}{(\Lg \cdot  x)^2}\left( \left[\vf \cdot \left(\Lg \cdot x\right)\right] \left(\PperpOp \Lg\right) +\left(\Lg \cdot x\right) \otimes \left[\vf \cdot \left( \PperpOp \Lg\right)\right] \right)
	\label{eq:reqvStab}
\eeq
where $A_{ij}=\frac{\partial \vf_i}{\partial x_j}$. This
expression allows to calculate stability of \reqva\ working
in the equivariant variables, without explicit knowledge of
the form the differential assumes in reduced space. Applying
\refeq{eq:reqvStab} for \reqv\ \REQV{}{1} of \CLe\ we obtain
the same eigenvalues \refeq{eq:CLeREQBstab} we computed in
polar coordinates along with a zero eigenvalue due to the
fact that we still work in the equivariant variables.

\subsection{Wrong: Stability of \reqva}
\label{sect:StabEqWrong}

In the moving frame method the reduced \statesp\ is
identified (at least locally) with the {\csection}
$\mathcal{K}$. This provides a means of calculating stability
of \reqva in reduced \statesp. Assume that, as was the case
for \CLe, the {\csection} is orthogonal to the group action
for any $x$ on $\mathcal{K}$. We observe that for the point
$x_o$ on \reqv\ \REQV{}{1} that lies on the {\csection}
$\mathcal{K}$ we can decompose $\vf(x)$ in \refeq{eq:difeq}
in a part $\vf_\shortparallel$ parallel to the group action
and a part $\vf_\perp$ on the {\csection}
\beq
	\vf(x_o)=\vf_\shortparallel(x_o)+\vf_\perp(x_o)\,.
\eeq
One can always write $\vf_\shortparallel(x_o)=c\Lg \cdot x$ where $c$ a constant.
    \ES{
    I believe that the following is wrong because $c$ will in
    general depend on the point on the {\csection} and thus
    when we consider variations we have to take this fact
    into account, yet I write it down since it is what we use
    for stability of \reqva\ in KS paper. Chossat and
    Lauterbach\rf{ChossLaut00} seem to take this into account
    but I don't know how to use their expressions in
    practice. The subsection with the same title as this one,
    I argue, is the correct way to do it, and also most
    straightforward.
    }
Then
\beq
	A_{ij}=\left.\frac{\partial\vf_i}{\partial x_j}\right|_{x_o}
          =c\Lg
           +\left.\frac{(\partial\vf_\perp)_i}{\partial x_j}\right|_{x_o}\,.
\eeq
Since hyperbolicity of a \reqv\ is determined by the dynamics
on the {\csection} (see \rf{Krupa90}) we identify
\beq
	\left.\frac{(\partial\vf_\perp)_i}{\partial x_j}\right|_{x_o}=\left.\frac{\partial\vf_i}{\partial x_j}\right|_{x_o}-c\Lg
\eeq
as the fundamental matrix which we are able to compute
without explicitly computing the dynamics on the {\csection}.

\subsection{Integration on the {\slice}}
\label{sec:IntSliceI}

If we replace our differential equations \refeq{eq:difeq}
with the system
\beq
	\frac{dx}{dt}=\PperpOp v(x)\,,
	\label{eq:difeqTransv}
\eeq
solutions will stay on the {\slice} $\mathcal{K}$ for any
initial condition on $\mathcal{K}$ as there is no component
of $\PperpOp v(x)$ in the direction of the continuous
symmetry.

For \CLe\ a trajectory of \refeq{eq:difeqTransv} on the
unstable manifold of \REQV{}{1} is shown in
\reffig{fig:CLEtransv}. Our claim that the trajectory will
stay on the {\slice} is not verified by this figure,
even though this could be attributed to numerical issues.
    \PC{ I would guess there is bug here - there is too much
    of a drift to be accumulation of numerical errors -
    direction is marginal, so one expects errors to induce a
    diffusive random walk, spreading with $t^{1/2}$, \ie,
    very slowly. It's better than \reffig{fig:CLE}, but not
    by much. How by starting both full \statesp\ and
    {\slice} integrations at the same point, and
    tracking the distance $(\ssp(t)-\ssp^\perp(t))^2$ of the
    two trajectories in the \reffig{fig:CLEinv} projection -
    if they diverge exponentially, we need to figure out what
    is wrong with the {\slice} integration. }

In figure \reffig{fig:CLEerrTransv} we evaluate the accuracy
of integration of \refeq{eq:difeqTransv} by integrating
initial conditions for several \rpo s both in \statesp\ and
on the section and compute the distance
$|\overline{\ssp}(t)-\overline{\ssp}^\perp(t)|$ in invariant
variables \refeq{eq:invLaser2} (the norm is Euclidean). The
distance does not grow exponentially indicating that
numerical solution of \refeq{eq:difeqTransv} is accurate.
    \PC{\refFig{fig:CLEtransv} shows that there is something
    wrong with the way you implement dynamics within the
    {\slice}, as a relative periodic must surely close into a
    periodic one, as there is no motion in the translational
    direction. \refFig{fig:CLEerrTransv} shows that the error
    you make is only in the transverse direction, hence no
    significant error when you project it onto quotiented
    dynamics. {\bf PC Oct 2009:} in the above, I was wrong.
